    Factory, we build analytics into our games to help us to improve them to give

    fully respects the user''s privacy and never collects information that could be
    directly linked to the user. AI Factory also displays advertisements to fund the
    creation of these games. This is all governed by the following privacy policy:

    note that by using or otherwise accessing any AI Factory mobile application, you
    are agreeing to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to this privacy policy,
