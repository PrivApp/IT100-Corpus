Job&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads</span> are created and provided by third parties over whom Indeed exercises no control; you acknowledge and understand that we have no control over the content of Job <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads or links to and from Job Ads</span>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ome of these third parties may attempt to charge job seekers a fee to apply to a particular job, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lthough Indeed endeavors not to make such Job Ads available on the Site</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;Indeed’s&nbsp;service, which is free to Job Seekers,&nbsp;links to Job Ads and has no control over any&nbsp;conditions third parties might impose once a Job Seeker&nbsp;has submitted an application or left the Indeed website. If you leave the Indeed website and choose to enter a third-party website, you accept any terms and conditions imposed by that third-party.&nbsp;</span>Except for certain sponsored, featured or paid placements, the Job&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads</span> contained on, or linked from, the Site are indexed or posted in an automated manner. <strong><i>Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Job Ads, or to include any Job&nbsp;Ads in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any Job&nbsp;Ads from the Site for any or no reason.</i></strong> We cannot confirm the accuracy or completeness of&nbsp;any Job Listing or other information submitted by any employer or other user, including the identity of such employer or other user. Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any Job <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads</span>. You agree that Indeed may also provide search options to narrow down Job&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads</span> search results by job type (i.e. full-time, part-time, etc.), and such job types are created independently and entirely by Indeed, and are not a direct reflection of the actual Job <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ads</span>. While <span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed may in some circumstances be compensated by employers who post Job Ads (helping keep Indeed free for jobseekers), all Job Ads are considered advertising. Indeed ranks Job Ads based on a combination of employer bids and relevance, such as search terms and other activity on Indeed.</span></p> 
        <p>Please note that while this Agreement describes Indeed’s services generally, services may differ by availability, and you should check the Site in your location to see which services are available to you. For example, while some parts of this Agreement describe matching services, Indeed does not offer any matching services in Japan.</p> 
        <p><strong>1(a) Notice to Users Applying to Jobs Through Indeed:&nbsp;</strong>If you are a Job Seeker, any resume or application information that you submit through the Site, including Personal Data included in a resume or application, is subject to this Agreement (including Section 4 below) and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Without limiting the foregoing, however, please note that by creating a public Indeed Resume through the Site, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available your resume to any Employer that Indeed believes may have an interest in your resume. By creating or uploading an Indeed Resume, Indeed may contact you to share Job Listings with you that match the contents of your Indeed Resume. You acknowledge and agree that employers may request that Indeed assemble your application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document, and you agree that Indeed assembles these application materials on your behalf. When you apply for a job on Indeed you agree to Indeed’s performance of automated processing in relation to your application, such processing is an essential part of this Agreement. To maintain the quality of the Site and Services, Indeed in its sole discretion may impose limits on the use of Indeed Apply or other Indeed services. In addition, when you indicate your interest in a Job Listing through Indeed Apply or by RSVPing to a hiring event (hereinafter, all references on the Site to “Apply Now”, “Easily Apply”, “Simple Apply”, “Apply from your phone”, “Apply with Indeed”, “RSVP to hiring event” or any similar references are referred to as “Indeed Apply”) you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to reformat the job so that you may read it more clearly in your phone, you are sending your resume and application information to Indeed, and you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make available such application information to the applicable Employer(s) for such Job Listing(s). When you ask Indeed to transmit an application or a message, including, but not limited to, a signed offer letter, to an Employer via Indeed Apply or Indeed’s relay system or store such application, you understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to reformat such application or message. Indeed may also insert functionality into messages relating to your application allowing you to place calls directly to third parties. Please note this functionality is provided solely as a courtesy and that such calls are not placed through or tracked by Indeed. Your standard calling rates with your phone provider will apply. Indeed also does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, be notified about, access, read or respond to any such resume or application material, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur. Indeed may also send you emails from the career or hiring guides as part of its services to you. These emails may include but not be limited to, tips on improving your resume or how to use your resume effectively in the job application process, commonly asked interview questions, next steps after you have submitted an application, and how to prepare for a new job after you have been hired.</p> 
        <p>Indeed may offer you the opportunity to receive a text message interview reminder from Indeed when the Employer has scheduled interviews with you. In such an event you will enter your phone number on the Indeed consent form and by entering your phone number you are representing and confirming it is your number and you have the right to accept&nbsp; text messages at the number. Indeed will only send you a text message reminder for such interview and you agree to accept such text message reminder on your cell phone including messages sent by automated telephone dialing system.&nbsp;Please note that since these text message services depend on the functionality of third-party providers, there may be technical delays on the part of those providers. We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third parties to receive such text messages.</p> 
        <p>In addition, by using Indeed, you agree that Indeed is not responsible for the content of the Employer’s Job Ad, application form, messages, screener questions, testing assessments or their format or method of delivery and that Indeed does not guarantee receipt of your application by the Employer, or your receipt of messages from the Employer. Please note that Indeed does not choose the questions asked by Employers or decide the job qualification criteria of Employers. Indeed may inform Job Seekers that an Employer’s requirement from a job description does not appear to be present on a resume; this information is presented without warranty and Indeed does not guarantee that updating a resume will result in any job offer. Indeed is not responsible for the content or accessibility of Job Ads or other material provided by third-party Employers for publication.<strong>&nbsp;If you require&nbsp;</strong><b>alternative methods of screening or application you must approach the Employer directly to request such as Indeed is not responsible for the Employer application process.&nbsp;</b></p> 
        <p>By using Indeed Apply and answering screener questions, you acknowledge that Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have not answered the questions in a manner that the Employer so wishes, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections. When you apply to a job using the Indeed Apply button, Indeed will attempt to send your application to the contact information provided to us by an Employer or their Agent.&nbsp;<span style="color: #de350b;"><b>We cannot guarantee that such messages and </b></span><span style="color: #de350b;"><b>applications will be delivered, received, read or acted upon</b></span>. The messages including applications may not be delivered, may not be received, may not be read and may not be acted upon. In addition we cannot vouch for the validity of such contact information provided to us. We also cannot vouch for the technical capabilities of any third party sites, including but not limited to Applicant Tracking Systems (ATSs).&nbsp;<span style="color: #de350b;"><b>If you do not feel</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #de350b;"><b>comfortable sending an application or messages in this manner, or having</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #de350b;"><b>your application or messages stored on Indeed, do not use the Indeed Apply</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #de350b;"><b>or Indeed relay functions and please send your application or messages</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #de350b;"><b>directly to the Employer by whatever other method you so choose, including</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #de350b;"><b>the public mail system. You may contact the Employer directly to find</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #de350b;"><b>alternative methods of application if you do not wish to apply through</b>&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #de350b;"><b>Indeed. By using the Indeed Apply system, you fully consent to the above.</b></span> Additionally, you consent to your application and any responses sent to you by the Employer (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Indeed shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled. Indeed may use your application materials (including public resumes and responses to screener questions) to determine whether you may be interested in a Job Listing, and Indeed may reach out to you about such Job Listing.&nbsp;<strong>Indeed does not guarantee the identity of an Employer or any individuals working for any Employers, and cautions Job Seekers when applying to jobs.&nbsp;Indeed does not guarantee the validity of a job offer and cautions Job Seekers to verify the validity of a job offer before taking an adverse action regarding their current employment situations. Job Seekers are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of any Employer or job offer.</strong></p> 
        <p><strong>1(b) </strong>If you are an Employer, when you create an Indeed account, a Career Page or post a Job Listing on the Site, whether as part of the Indeed Ads Program or otherwise, you agree that this Agreement and all of Indeed’s policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy, apply to you and to the Job Seekers using such Career Page or indicating an interest in such Job Listings. &nbsp;Specifically, when you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called Mitek. <span style="font-weight: 400;">By using Mitek, you are submitting your identification documents for verification directly to Mitek, you are agreeing to share your identification with Mitek, and you agree that Mitek is solely responsible for any use or loss of data. Indeed may have access to your identification documents via Mitek.</span>&nbsp;You also agree that, as a service to Job Seekers, Indeed may activate its Indeed Apply relay function for use in connection with such Job Listing, and that any Job Seekers who wish to indicate an interest in such Job Listing may only do so through Indeed Apply, and that Indeed will send applications to the email address you provide us with. <span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use Indeed candidate management tools, including but not limited to your Employer Dashboard, or by activating the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Ads, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may make available certain functions allowing you to take actions regarding the Job Seeker, such as tools for setting up an interview, viewing a resume and rejecting a candidate. You agree that by using such candidate management tools, you are instructing Indeed to assemble the candidate’s application materials, resume, answers to screener questions, assessment responses and other information you provide to Indeed into one document. You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for maintaining or storing such application materials, and that you are responsible for your own compliance with any applicable record retention requirements.When you use the Indeed Apply relay function for your Job Ads, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed may add certain functions into the email. By using these tools, you also agree that Indeed may monitor and analyze these actions. When using the Indeed Apply function, Indeed will attempt to send applications to the contact information provided to Indeed by you, the Employer. Indeed has no ability to verify the contact information provided by You. In the event you provide incorrect contact information, it shall be your responsibility to correct, appropriately respond, or take any steps necessary to protect the privacy of such Job Seekers, and you indemnify Indeed for any damages resulting therefrom. In addition, Indeed may, on your behalf, send out reminder emails to Job Seekers you wish to interview. Indeed may also send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume. </span>Indeed is not responsible for the content of your emails, application form, screener questions or their format, and disclaims all liability for such content, including as to whether such content is legal. Indeed further does not guarantee delivery, your receipt of the Job Seeker’s emails or application materials, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission or storage of the data. In the event a message being sent is intended for a closed account, these messages will not be deliverable. When you use screener questions, you may be given the option to instruct Indeed to send out rejection notices if the Job Seeker has not answered the questions in the manner set forth in the online instruction. If you choose such option, you agree you are instructing us to send out rejection notices to such candidates and set them to rejected in your Employer dashboard. You further acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of these or all other rejection notifications (which is purely mechanical), that transmission or storage is not guaranteed, and that the Job Seeker may not have answered the screener questions accurately. When you use Indeed’s candidate management tools, you may be given the option to send automatic rejection notices to candidates whose status you set to “rejected”. If you choose such option, you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission or storage of rejection notices. You agree that Indeed may take action to try to identify and reduce spam applications, and that one method of doing so may include imposing a cover letter requirement for such applicants.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Indeed does not verify the identity of any Job Seekers who apply to your job listing, nor does Indeed know a Job Seeker’s motivation for applying to your job listing, and thus provides no guarantee as to the Job Seeker’s qualifications or interest in your job listing. You agree that Indeed Apply and Indeed’s relay functions are presented to you without warranty and Indeed assumes no responsibility for the communications between you and the Job Seeker, which communications are yours’ and the Job Seekers’ sole responsibility.&nbsp;If you do not feel comfortable sending a message, including but not limited to an offer letter, to a Job Seeker through Indeed’s relay functions, do not use the Indeed relay functions and please contact the Job Seeker via the personal information provided in such Job Seeker’s resume or application or by whatever method you so choose.<b>&nbsp;</b>By using any automated phone screen product, you agree that you are requesting Indeed to send a Job Seeker a telephone number, which the Job Seeker may call with the purpose of answering your telephone screening questions. You agree these questions are part of your application process, are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed. You also agree that you are only asking Indeed to record the Job Seeker’s answers to your screening questions and that Indeed will forward you the recording of the answers to your questions. You consent to Indeed listening to and analyzing the recording in accordance with Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Indeed disclaims all warranties with regards to the transmission or storage of such phone screens and responses, does not guarantee their delivery or receipt, and does not guarantee the date or time at which they may be sent. When you respond to or contact a Job Seeker who has used Indeed Resume, or Indeed Apply, you are providing information to Indeed and requesting and authorizing us to make available such information to the applicable Job Seeker. Additionally, you consent to Job Seekers’ applications and any responses sent by you (including offer letters) through Indeed being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Indeed shall store such information regardless of whether a job vacancy has been filled. You are responsible for the contents of any Career Page that you create, any Job Listings that you post, and any messages that you send through Indeed Apply or otherwise, including any questions for Job Seekers. You agree that Indeed may reject or remove any Job Listing, any part of any Career Page, or any questions for Job Seekers for any or no reason. You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of any Career Page created by you, or any Job Listing or screener questions (or answers thereto) posted by you, or any message sent by you (including any questions for Job Seekers contained in any of the foregoing). Indeed may make Job Ad analytics data available on a Company Page or elsewhere on the Site, and may provide analytics data regarding your Employer account to anyone at your company at Indeed’s discretion. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance. Indeed may elect to apply (i) penalties for late payment as per contemporaneous US Federal Reserve interest rates plus 10% or the maximum interest permitted by law, whichever is lower and (ii) a statutory lump-sum indemnity for recovery cost, if provided for under applicable laws, and (iii) any reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting such late payments.</p> 
        <p><strong>1(c) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, when you view, send, store or receive materials (including Job Listings, resumes, and messages) through or using the Site, Indeed may, for example, use such materials for data analysis, quality control, or to refine the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including to provide better search results and other listings for Job Seekers and Employers), whether via automated means or otherwise. When an Employer views, sends, stores or receives materials through or using the Site, Indeed may also inform a Job Seeker that an Employer has taken an action with regards to a Job Ad,&nbsp; Job Seeker’s Resume, or application such as pausing or closing a Job Ad, opening the Resume or application, viewing the Resume or application, responding to the Resume or application, and making a decision with regards to the application or Job Ad, and you hereby consent to Indeed taking such actions. Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of any job listing, Career Page, job solicitation, screener question, answer to screener question, resume information you post, send or receive through the Site. If you see any inaccuracy in any such material, it is your responsibility to correct such information or to contact Indeed to do so.</p> 
        <p><strong>1(d) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may use application materials (including resumes and responses to screener questions) and the recency of your activity on Indeed to determine whether the words of any Job Seeker’s resume and answers to screener questions match the words of a Job Listing or Resume query, and vice-versa. Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, you agree and consent that Indeed may differentiate those matching resumes and screener questions from those that do not match, and present them to Employers as matches or not matches. Indeed may also use such information in order to improve the Site or any other Indeed product or service (including by displaying or otherwise making available potentially relevant Job Listings and resumes to Job Seekers and Employers).</p> 
        <p><strong>1(e)</strong> Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may provide certain categories of information to you for informational purposes only. For example, Indeed may provide you with data regarding estimated salaries for a certain Job Listing, or about estimated applies to a Job Listing you may receive as an Employer. &nbsp;These figures provided by Indeed are estimates given for informational purposes only, and they are subject to change or varying levels of accuracy. &nbsp;With respect to information regarding estimated applies, if you are an Employer participating in the Indeed Ads Program, please note that this is not the information you are purchasing from Indeed and you are not charged per apply. Indeed may also include salary estimations on pages other than Job Listings on the Site. Please note that all salary figures are approximations based upon multiple third party submissions to Indeed, including from Indeed affiliates. These figures are given to Indeed users for the purpose of generalized comparison only. Minimum wage may differ by jurisdiction and you should consult the employer for actual salary figures.</p> 
        <p><strong>1(f)</strong> Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may provide certain types of career-related or hiring-related information on its Site. All information contained in&nbsp;any Indeed career or hiring guide is for informational purposes only, and is in no way to be construed as professional career counseling or staffing services. You understand that Indeed may give suggestions or information regarding best-practices, however, you understand that it is ultimately your responsibility to determine how to pursue your job search or candidate search. You&nbsp;further understand that in providing&nbsp;any such career or hiring guides, Indeed is not acting as a job placement agency or staffing firm. You also understand that by referring to or using such career or hiring guides, you are not guaranteed job interviews, job placement, assurance of being hired, job candidates, or hires, and you take full responsibility for use of these services or guides.&nbsp;As a user of the Site, Indeed may, from time to time, send you emails from the career or hiring guides as part of its services to you. These emails may include but not be limited to, tips on improving your resume or how to use your resume effectively in the job application process, commonly asked interview questions, next steps after you have submitted an application, and how to prepare for a new job after you have been hired.</p> 
        <p><strong>1(g</strong><strong>) </strong>Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, Indeed may provide you an online questionnaire relating to your industry and/or your hiring or job searching needs. Indeed may match&nbsp;a Job Seeker’s responses to such questionnaires to determine, on the basis of the Employer’s responses to a questionnaire about its industry and/or hiring needs, whether such Job Seeker would match&nbsp;the Employer’s hiring criteria as specified&nbsp;in the Employer’s&nbsp;questionnaire responses. In the event Indeed determines that a Job Seeker matches&nbsp;the Employer’s hiring criteria, Indeed may connect such matching Job Seeker and Employer by sending a note informing both parties of the match, including but not limited to sending an Employer a short description of a Job Seeker taken directly from the Job Seeker’s responses to the questionnaire. In all events you will know what data we are providing to either a Job Seeker or Employer, or upon which we relied to make the match, because you have actively submitted it. If the Employer and Job Seeker&nbsp;express interest in each other, you agree Indeed may provide the Employer with an email address for the Job Seeker either provided by Indeed or the Job Seeker and, if you are a Job Seeker, you consent to this. Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, by submitting&nbsp;the completed questionnaire, you agree and consent to Indeed (i) conducting such matching, utilizing only material you have submitted through the questionnaire process, (ii) presenting matching Job Seekers to Employers, and vice versa and (iii) storing and analyzing such data submitted in response to such online questionnaires.</p> 
        <p><strong>New: 1(h)&nbsp;</strong>If you are a Job Seeker, you take a variety of actions on our Site. For example, you search for jobs, and Indeed knows and stores the titles of jobs you search for and click on,&nbsp;where those jobs are located, any information, including salary interest or experience of which you have informed Indeed, or the general salary range or experience level of the jobs you view (if indicated on the Job&nbsp;Listings), the Job&nbsp;Listings you apply to, your amount of activity or time of most recent activity on Indeed, or any of your other behavior on the Indeed site, when you use Indeed. You know exactly what this data is because you are the person who undertook the activity and the data pertains only to your activity. If you have an Indeed account or an Indeed-hosted resume, you agree that Indeed may associate this data with your Indeed profile and use this observed factual data to suggest jobs to you and to suggest you or your public resume to Employers that might be interested in a person who&nbsp;matches your behavior on Indeed. You also agree that Indeed may contact you based on this&nbsp;observed behavior for Employers or for Indeed itself. Please note, although information may be sent to you by a third party through the Indeed system,&nbsp;the aforementioned behavior does not include information relayed to you. However, Indeed may publicly display the fact that you have recently used the Indeed Site or the fact that you have recently used the Indeed system to correspond with a third party.&nbsp;<strong>In addition, if you are located in the United States and you set your Resume to public, this means that Indeed may share all of the aforementioned information about yourself with third-party Employers. If you do not wish to share such information, you may set your Resume to private.</strong></p> 
        <p><strong>1(i)&nbsp;</strong>If you are a Job Seeker, please note that Indeed may automatically send you recommended jobs via the email address you use to create an Indeed account or apply to a job. Indeed may determine what these recommended jobs are on the basis of a variety of factors, including but not limited to, any information you input on the Site about yourself, searches you run on the Site, jobs you click on, jobs you apply to, or the materials you provide in a job application to an Employer through Indeed.</p> 
        <p><strong>1(j) Screening Tools</strong>: &nbsp;Indeed may make screening tools available to Employers for Employer use in the application process, including screener questions, phone screen tools and employee assessments. Indeed is licensing these tools to you for your use as you determine. By using any screening product, made available to you by Indeed, you agree that you have made the determination to use these tools as part of your application process, and the substantive questions you ask or choose are solely determined by you, and are not being asked by Indeed. &nbsp;You are the sole party to determine which answers will qualify a candidate. You are solely responsible for the use of the screening tool including any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact”.&nbsp;<b>You further acknowledge that you are responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act.</b>&nbsp;Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of these questions would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent state act. You the Employer agree to indemnify Indeed for any and all claims arising out of an Employer’s &nbsp;use of a Screening Tool, including any claims that any screening tool does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or that such Screening Tool results in a “disparate impact”.</p>

        <p><strong>1(n) </strong>When you post a Job Ad directly on Indeed, Indeed may automatically generate for you a Company Page. You authorize Indeed to claim such Company Page for you on your behalf, which will be marked as a “Claimed Profile” and allows you to edit and add information to the Company Page. Company Pages allow User Content to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Company that owns the Company Page, including but not limited to the answers to Q&amp;A questions on Company Pages. Additionally, Indeed may include all of your Job Ads posted on the Site on your Company Page, including but not limited to those posted directly on Indeed as well as those indexed by Indeed. You agree that you are solely responsible for any content you put on a Company Page, whether generated by or for you, including but not limited to photograph(s) or videos you provide, and third-party websites reachable from content you put on a Company Page. Indeed may additionally offer Indeed Company Pages Premium, which includes certain features accessible only on a subscription basis and may be charged as indicated in an insertion order. Indeed reserves the right to change or remove these features at any time, in Indeed’s sole discretion. Additionally, these features may include analytics or other figures, which Indeed does not guarantee the accuracy of, and you are responsible for determining their suitability for your intended use or purpose. Information on company pages may come from the respective company or may come from third parties. For example, data about companies located in Japan may come from Toyo Keizai Shinpo Inc.</p> 
        <p><strong>1(o) </strong>Some Indeed products, such as Onboarding, may offer an e-signature option. This e-signing option is offered through Docusign, and Indeed disclaims all warranties associated with it, including but not limited to any errors associated with the software or the validity of the signature. Your use of the e-signature option is at your own risk. Regardless of whether you are an Employer or Job Seeker, it is your responsibility to follow-up with the Employer or Job Seeker to ensure that they received your communication, including the offer letter. Indeed is not your record keeper, to the extent the law requires you to retain a copy of the offer letter, it is your responsibility to retain such copy.</p> 
        <p><strong>1(p)</strong> Indeed may offer a service called Indeed Central to facilitate the coordination of Job Ads within geographically distributed businesses, such as franchises or large companies with many locations. You acknowledge and agree that using Indeed Central involves sharing a franchisee’s account information with the franchisor, or sharing a local office’s account information with the corporate headquarters, as applicable. This information may include items such as the number of your business locations or accounts, information about your job ads (content, clicks, impressions, etc.), your contact information, and your spend levels. The franchisor or corporate headquarters may request that Indeed contact its franchisees or local offices, respectively, by providing Indeed with contact information, and may provide the content of Job Ads to Indeed for use in connection with Indeed Central. By using Indeed Central, you agree to this information being shared, and you represent and warrant that i) all information you provide to Indeed is accurate, and ii) you have all necessary right and authorization to provide such information to Indeed and to permit Indeed to share it in connection with Indeed Central.</p> 
        <p><b>1(q)</b> Employer Assist. Indeed may offer Employers the ability to activate a feature on their account called Employer Assist.&nbsp;Activating Employer Assist means the Employer is instructing Indeed to send a message&nbsp;on the Employer’s behalf to the Job Seeker informing them that the Employer has determined not to move forward with their application. As a Job Seeker, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed has no discretion in the sending of these messages, and that any such messages are solely a result of the Employer’s decision to activate Employer Assist and to not take an action on your application within the time period selected by the Employer. As an Employer, if you activate Employer Assist&nbsp;you agree that you are instructing Indeed to send these messages to candidates with whom you do not interact within your chosen time frame, and you agree to indemnify Indeed from any claims arising therefrom.</p> 
        <p><strong>2. External Sites</strong></p> 
        <p>The Site contains links to other sites on the Internet which are owned and/or operated by third-party vendors and other third parties (the “External Sites”). You acknowledge that Indeed is not responsible or liable for any such third parties or for the availability of, or the materials located on or through, any External Sites. You should contact the site administrator or webmaster for the applicable External Site if you have any concerns regarding such links or the materials located on an External Site.</p> 
        <p>In addition, Indeed may provide you with links to certain third party sites that offer you services for your use or benefit. We may stop offering any such third party sites or services at any time. <strong>If you choose to use such third party sites or services, you enter into an agreement with such third party alone at your own risk.</strong> When entering into an agreement with such parties, you are giving them your data directly and your rights and their obligations are determined by their privacy policies and terms of service. <strong>We are not responsible for any content or services provided by these third parties, and disclaim all liability from anything that may occur when you utilize such third parties. We are additionally not responsible for any payment that may be asked of you by such third party. You will be notified on the site that these are third party sites and services, and not Indeed.</strong></p> 
        <p>Certain pages on the Site may embed content and information provided by third-party APIs, which is subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by those third parties. For example, the Site may include Google Maps features and content, which is subject to the current versions of: (1) the Google Maps/Google Earth Additional Terms of Service at&nbsp;<a class="external-link" title="Follow link" href="https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html" rel="nofollow">https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html</a>; and (2) the Google Privacy Policy at&nbsp;<a class="external-link" title="Follow link" href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p> 
        <p><strong>3. Use of Site</strong></p> 
        <p>You are not permitted to use Indeed’s Site or its content other than for non-commercial purposes. Use of any automated system or software, whether operated by a third party or otherwise, to extract data from the Site (such as screen scraping or crawling) is prohibited. Indeed reserves the right to take such action as it considers necessary, including issuing legal proceedings without further notice, in relation to any unauthorized use of the Site. If you wish to make commercial use of the Site, if you wish to make use of the Site in any capacity other than that of a Jobseeker or Employer, or if you wish to purchase Indeed services that utilize the Site, you must have a prior written agreement with Indeed to do so, or have accepted Indeed’s online terms of service. Please <a href="http://www.indeed.com/support/contact">contact us</a>&nbsp;for more information. We reserve the right at all times (but will not have any obligation) to terminate users, and reclaim usernames or URLs, for any reason.</p> 
        <p><strong>4. User Content</strong></p> 
        <p>Some parts of the Site, such as message boards and forums, may allow users to post Job Listings, resumes, information, text, images, audio, video, messages, and other materials (any such materials that a user submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on or through the Site, or any materials that a user submits to Indeed, where it is stated that such materials may be posted on the Site, are referred to herein as “User Content”). Such functionality is designed to help users obtain career and company information, facilitate communication, discuss ways to make career decisions, and to let users know of jobs. User Content is provided by third-party contributors, many of whom may use anonymous screen names. User Content may be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or deceptive. For example, the Site hosts Company Pages, which allow User Content to be posted by individuals that may not be affiliated with the Company who owns the Company Page, including but not limited to the answers to Q&amp;A questions on Company Pages. Indeed does not endorse and is not responsible for any User Content, including any opinion, advice, information, or statement contained therein.&nbsp;Certain elements of Indeed job search results pages may appear to be content produced by Indeed, but are actually a reproduction of user-generated search queries. You acknowledge that by accessing the Site, you may come into contact with content (including User Content) that you find harmful, offensive, threatening, indecent or objectionable, including, but not limited to, explicit language and other potentially offensive material, and you acknowledge that Indeed shall have no liability with respect to such content.</p> 
        <p>You must not post any User Content that is unlawful, fraudulent, discriminatory, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content. You must also not post any User Content that contains proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing), or encourages or causes spamming or flooding.</p> 
        <p>You are prohibited from posting any User Content containing official identification information (whether your own or of another person), such as social security number, passport number, national identification number, insurance number, driver’s license number, immigration number, or any other similar number, code, or identifier. Posting such identification information may lead to identity theft and other adverse consequences. Indeed may remove any such identification information, but does not undertake any obligation to do so, and has no responsibility and disclaims all liability for any posting of such identification information. Indeed reserves the right to change the display of resume on its Site, including, but not limited to, hiding fields, rearranging its format, and changing visual elements.</p> 
        <p>Although Indeed has no obligation to do so, Indeed may monitor User Content, and reserves the right to delete any User Content or portion thereof that, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates the above rules, including any User Content that is unrelated to the specific portion of the Site on which it is posted, or that is an advertisement, recruiting or other commercial message (other than Job Advertisements permitted by this Agreement), or that Indeed deems in its sole discretion to be inappropriate. If you believe that any User Content violates this Agreement or our policies, please <a href="http://www.indeed.com/support/contact">contact Indeed</a> immediately so that we may have the opportunity to consider its removal. You acknowledge and agree that Indeed does not have any obligation to remove any User Content, and any decision regarding: i) whether any User Content violates any Indeed policy, ii) whether to publish or to withdraw from publication any User Content, and iii) whether to exclude any material that any party seeks to post on Indeed, will always remain within the sole discretion of Indeed. You agree that Indeed has no liability to you or anyone else arising from its editorial decisions. You acknowledge and agree that Indeed is an interactive computer service and does not have any obligation to screen any User Content, or to include any User Content (including without limitation Job Ads) in its search results or other listings, and may exclude or remove any User Content from publication for any or no reason.</p> 
        <p>Indeed reserves the right to disclose all User Content and other relevant information, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party in connection with operating the Site; to protect itself, its affiliates, its partners and its visitors; and to comply with legal obligations or governmental requests. This means, for example, that Indeed may honor subpoenas, search warrants, law enforcement or court-mandated requests to reveal a user’s electronic address and identity, or other properly requested information. As an Employer, when you post a Job Listing on Indeed that you choose to list as confidential, your identity may be discoverable by request from the government or law enforcement.</p> 
        <p>Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Indeed reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminates against Job Seekers. Direct discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing specifically makes clear that only Job Seekers matching a certain criteria are wanted, thereby excluding others because of, for example, their gender, race, age or disability. Indirect discrimination means, for example, that a Job Listing implicitly excludes certain classes of Job Seekers by making it impossible for them to qualify for the job requirements. You understand and agree that it is your responsibility to refrain from posting any Job Listing that directly or indirectly discriminate against Job Seekers or otherwise violate applicable law.</p> 
        <p>Please note: Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act provides that:</p> 
        <p>(1) Treatment of publisher or speaker</p>

        <p>(2) Civil liability</p> 
        <p>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of-</p> 
        <p>(A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or</p> 
        <p>(B) any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph (1).</p> 
        <p><strong>5. License to User Content and Feedback</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only to the extent permitted by law, you grant Indeed a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, (revocable only as described below), fully paid, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple layers of sub-licensees) right and license to make, use, sell, sublicense, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, prepare derivative works from and otherwise exploit all User Content you post or submit, for the purpose of publishing material on the Indeed website or its publishers, maintaining the Indeed website and promoting Indeed without restriction.&nbsp;You understand that no compensation in any form shall be due or payable to you in connection with Indeed’s exercise of its rights under the license granted under this Section.

        <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the User Content that you submit, post, display, or otherwise make available on or through the Site, or that you otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this section, (ii) such User Content, and its submission, posting, display or availability on or through the Site does not violate applicable law or the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person or entity, and (iii) such submission, posting, display or availability on or through the Site does not result in any breach of contract between you and any third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, damages, and any other monies owed to any person or entity by reason of such User Content. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Indeed and its affiliates from any claims resulting from any such User Content. If you wish to request to revoke the license granted by you in this Section for any such User Content, please send a certified letter of request to the postal address listed above with a copy of your passport or national identity card (for identity verification purposes) and request removal of such User Content. Your certified letter of request must include (a) the signature of the applicable rights holder for such User Content or a person authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder; (b) identification of the User Content for which the license is to be revoked, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate and remove such User Content on the Site; (c) your name, address, telephone number, and email address; (d) a statement that you have a good faith belief that you are the rights holder or authorized by the rights holder to revoke the license for the designated User Content; and (e) a statement that the information in the request is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the rights holder or are authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder with respect to such User Content. There may be a charge for answering and executing such a request; please contact Indeed for more details.</p> 
        <p>At your discretion, you may provide feedback and related materials to Indeed concerning the functionality and performance of the Site from time to time, including, without limitation, identifying potential errors, improvements, modifications, bug fixes, or enhancements (“Feedback”). If you, through your evaluation or otherwise, provide any Feedback, you hereby grant to Indeed a nonexclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple layers of sublicensees) right and license to make, use, sell, sublicense, reproduce, distribute, perform, display, prepare derivative works from and otherwise exploit all such Feedback for any purpose without restriction. You agree that Indeed may disclose any or all Feedback to any third party in any manner, and you agree that Indeed may sublicense any or all Feedback in any form to any third party without restriction. By providing any Feedback, you agree that your provision of such Feedback is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction, and will not place Indeed under any fiduciary, confidentiality or other obligation, and that we are free to use such Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and free to disclose such Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by accepting any Feedback, Indeed does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Indeed, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you.</p> 
        <p>Finally, if you are a member of Indeed Academy, your use of the Graduate logos is limited to your individual use only, and solely for purposes of indicating your Graduate status. Use of the Graduate logo to represent organizations or for commercial purposes is not permitted. Further, you agree and acknowledge that you will not make any representation that you are recruiting on behalf of Indeed, working for Indeed, or in any form of co-employment or contractor relationship with Indeed. Additionally, nothing contained herein shall be construed to imply a joint venture, partnership, principal-agent relationship or employer-employee relationship between you and Indeed, and neither Party shall have the right, power or authority to obligate or bind the other in any manner whatsoever, except as otherwise agreed to in writing. If you make any representation to the contrary, Indeed may remove you from Indeed Academy in its sole discretion.</p>

        <p>You agree that you shall not transmit to Indeed or upload to or through the Site (whether as User Content or otherwise) any Harmful Code, or use or misappropriate the Site for your own commercial gain. “Harmful Code” shall mean any software (sometimes referred to as “viruses,” “worms,” “Trojan horses,” “time bombs,” “time locks,” “drop dead devices,” “traps,” “access codes,” “cancelbots” or “trap door devices”) that: (a) is designed to damage, disrupt, disable, harm, impair, interfere with, intercept, expropriate or otherwise impede in any manner, any data, storage media, program, system, equipment or communication, based on any event, including for example but not limited to (i) exceeding a number of copies, (ii) exceeding a number of users, (iii) passage of a period of time, (iv) advancement to a particular date or other numeral, or (v) use of a certain feature; or (b) would enable an unauthorized person to cause such result; or (c) would enable an unauthorized person to access another person’s information without such other person’s knowledge and permission.

        <p>Indeed reserves the right to use any User Content (including the content of messages or material sent through or to the Site or Indeed) to prevent potentially illegal or tortious activities, or any other activities that are detrimental to other users. Indeed reserves the right to use a variety of methods to detect and block the above anomalous activity and to screen User Content to prevent abuse such as spam or fraud. However, such detection methods are not perfect and false positives may occur. If you use the Site, you agree to Indeed enforcing the above rules or attempting to prevent spam, fraud, or other anomalous activity. Such measures may result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of your account, of your access to Indeed’s message relay, or of your use of any other functions of the Site, with or without notice. Indeed shall not be responsible or liable for any such suspension or termination, including any consequences thereof.</p> 
        <p>Indeed reserves the right to drop any message with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment for any or no reason.&nbsp;Indeed further reserves the right to conduct investigations to determine whether you are perpetrating a scam, spamming Indeed or its users, or otherwise conducting fraudulent activity on Indeed by various means, including but not limited to investigating your functionality by setting up profiles and names that belong to Indeed.&nbsp;Indeed reserves the right to turn over any information gathered via such investigations to the police or other third party if Indeed has a good faith belief that you are using the Site in violation of these terms.</p> 
        <p><strong>7. Registration; Contact Information</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some areas of the Site, including areas that may permit you to set up an Indeed account, require you to register or provide an email address. If you so register, you agree to (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by our registration form (including your email address) and (b) be responsible for the confidentiality and use of your username and password, and not transfer or resell your use of or access to the Site to any third party. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that any individuals with whom you have shared your username and password and who are able to answer verification questions about your Indeed account may receive access to information regarding your Indeed account. If you are an Employer, your account is for business use and not for personal use. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Indeed is not responsible and disclaims all liability if your email is used improperly or falsely by a third party. By registering for an Indeed account, you agree to receive mandatory email updates regarding anomalous activity to your Indeed account. If you attempt to send an email from a name or email address that is not true, accurate, current or complete, we reserve the right to drop such email, and attempting to send such email is a violation of our terms. </span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some instances, multiple users may be linked to the same account (“a Linked Account”). A Linked Account is created when the primary account owner(s) (“Admin(s)”) of an Employer account invites other users to the same account. Admin(s) may be given the option to give these other users certain levels of access and functionality (“Roles”) within the account, as described on the site. If you are an Admin adding a user to a Role or several Roles, you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">represent to Indeed that you are an authorized representative of this account and that you have the authority to allow this data and access to be shared. You further agree to indemnify and hold harmless Indeed from any allegations, claims, actions, suits, demands, damages, liabilities, obligations, losses, settlements, judgments, costs and expenses (including without limitation attorneys’ fees and costs) that result from the sharing of this data and access to your account. You agree that Indeed assumes no liability in regards to the accuracy of the statements above and that you are fully responsible for said accuracy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When using a Linked Account, any users with access to certain Roles may have access to any or all account information, including but not limited to: communications and actions of all other users and applicants within the Linked Account, resume contacts, and billing information, and you consent to such access.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to terminate users or to reclaim usernames or URLs.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that Indeed may, as part of its services to you, communicate with you, or initiate communication with you on behalf of a third party, through your Indeed account or through other means such as email, telephone (including mobile phone), or postal mail, including through the use of contact information that you may provide to Indeed or that Indeed may otherwise obtain from third-party sources. By providing Indeed with a mobile phone number, you expressly consent to receiving communication via such mobile number. When you give Indeed a mobile number and consent to receiving communication, such communications are inherent to the services you have signed up for. To revoke consent at any time, reply to the text with STOP or contact <a href="https://www.indeed.com/support/contact">Indeed Customer Support</a>. You may also revoke your consent by terminating the Agreement through closing your Indeed account.&nbsp; By enabling two step verification, you verify that you are the owner of the phone number you provided.</span></p>

        <p><strong>10. Claims of Infringement</strong></p> 
        <p>U.S. Copyright Infringement. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA“) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Indeed infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information as required by 17 USC. § 512(c)(3)(A): (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Indeed to locate the material on the site; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Indeed a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent in writing to Indeed Copyright Notice, 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA (copyright @ indeed.com) (remove spaces when sending email). We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p> 
        <p>Other Claims of Infringement. For claims of infringement that do not involve a U.S. copyright, please contact us via our Site <a href="http://www.indeed.com/support/contact">contact form</a>.</p>

In the event of any irreconcilable conflict between this Agreement and the Indeed Ads Program Terms, Indeed Resume Program Terms, Seen by Indeed Terms and Indeed Targeted Ads Terms (if applicable to you), the Indeed Ads Program Terms, Indeed Resume Program Terms, Seen by Indeed Terms and Indeed Targeted Ads Terms will govern with respect to the Indeed Ads Program, Indeed Resume Program, Seen by Indeed and Indeed Targeted Ads, respectively, and the Agreement will otherwise govern. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by Indeed. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Indeed in connection with the Site, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Indeed concerning the Site. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. You agree that this Agreement cannot be altered, amended, modified or overridden, except by a document signed by an authorized representative of each party. For the avoidance of doubt, email or phone communication between you and an Indeed employee shall not constitute an amendment or alteration of this Agreement.</p> 
        <p>By accessing or using the Site, you signify your assent to this Agreement and agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including U.S. export and re-export control laws and regulations, copyright laws and other laws regarding intellectual property.

        <p>Change of Address: If you have provided a billing address to us, and you change such billing address from an address within the United States to an address outside the United States, or from an address outside of the United States to an address inside the United States, you will continue to be bound by this Agreement with the same Indeed party for the remainder of the calendar month in which you made the change. Beginning on the first day of the next calendar month, you hereby agree that you will be bound by this Agreement with the applicable Indeed party identified in the first paragraph of this Agreement with respect to such new territory.</p> 
        <p>Any notices to Indeed must be sent to the applicable Indeed entity identified in the first paragraph of this Agreement via certified first class or air mail or overnight courier, are deemed given upon receipt, and must reference the Program that is the subject of the notice (i.e., Indeed Ads Program, Indeed Resume Program, or Indeed Publisher Program). Notice to you may be effected by sending email to the email address specified in your account, or by posting a message to your account interface, and is deemed received when sent (for email) or no more than fifteen (15) days after having been posted (for messages in your Indeed Ads interface).</p> 
        <p>You may not assign or delegate any of your rights or obligations hereunder without Indeed’s prior written consent and any such attempt is void. Indeed may freely assign or delegate its rights and obligations hereunder without notice to you.

        <p>In addition to your agreement with the foregoing terms and conditions, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the following provisions apply with respect to your use of any mobile application version of the Site compatible with the iOS operating system of Apple Inc.

Any inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the App, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to Indeed in accordance with the “Information or Complaints” section above. The license you have been granted herein is limited to a non-transferable license to use the App on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple’s iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by you, or as otherwise permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Service. In addition, you must comply with the terms of any third-party agreement applicable to you when using the App, such as your wireless data service agreement. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement and, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof; notwithstanding the foregoing, Indeed’s right to enter into, rescind or terminate any variation, waiver or settlement under this Agreement is not subject to the consent of any third party.</p> 
        <p><strong>18.&nbsp;The Indeed Apps</strong></p>

        <p>Last Updated: July 15, 2019</p> 
        <p>These Indeed Resume Program Terms or Indeed CV Program Terms (collectively, “IRP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the <a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#tos">Indeed Terms of Service</a> (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer that accesses or uses the Indeed Resume Program, or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Resume Program Terms.</p> 
        <p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IRP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p> 
        <p><strong>1. The Program</strong></p> 
        <p>Use of the Indeed Resume Program (“Program”) by an individual who posts his or her resume on the Site (hereinafter, “Resume Owner”) or Employer on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed best-practice guidelines, policies and other terms and conditions made available to you, including through the Site, on the subscription purchase page, and on the FAQ and information page(s) for the country you are purchasing a subscription for, any or all of which may be modified at any time. You shall not use any information obtained from the Site except for internal use in selecting and contacting Resume Owners, through Indeed, for purposes of filling your Job Listings.&nbsp;You are expressly forbidden from using any product or system intended to extract the information from a Resume, in order to circumvent the Resume contact system. Use of such system will result in your immediate termination from the Program. In addition, as a feature of the IRP, Indeed may&nbsp;send emails to Job Seekers on your behalf indicating that your Job Listing is potentially a match for the Job Seeker’s resume.</p> 
        <p>IMPORTANT NOTICE : YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT: in purchasing or obtaining access to the Program, you are&nbsp;paying&nbsp;Indeed the amount&nbsp;indicated on the Site for the purpose of&nbsp;Indeed facilitating your contact with a Resume Owner by sending a message to the email address that the relevant Resume Owner has provided to Indeed.&nbsp;Your use of the Program is subject to all Indeed Site Rules and policies, including the Indeed Privacy Policy and any policies pertaining to Relay Services. Indeed does not guarantee that the email address is still in use, that such message&nbsp;will be received, that such message will be read, that such message will be acted upon by any potential Resume Owner, or that any Resume Owner’s resume is valid, accurate or complete in any respect.&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed may return different results for the same resume search query and has full discretion with respect to the resumes or profiles it presents in response to any particular search.</span></strong><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></strong>In addition, in accord with the Agreement, you expressly agree that Indeed does not allow its Resume Contact service to be used in a spam like manner, which Indeed defines as sending requests for job positions to persons who are, as indicated by Indeed experience and Resume Owner behavior and reaction, unsuited for the role. Indeed reserves the right to disable Indeed Resume contact service for any user who, in Indeed’s sole discretion, violates these IRP Terms, including the foregoing term. We reserve the right to drop&nbsp;messages in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy, including without limitation dropping any message&nbsp;with an .ade, .adp, .bat, .chm, .cmd, .com, .cpl, .exe, .hta, .ins, .isp, .jar, .jse, .lib, .lnk, .mde, .msc, .msp, .mst, .pif, .scr, .sct, .shb, .sys, .vb, .vbe, .vbs, .vxd, .wsc, .wsf, .wsh, or .zip attachment for any or no reason. <strong>The only acceptable use of the IRP is for you to contact a Resume Owner through Indeed regarding a Job Listing or potential employment. No other uses of the IRP are permitted.&nbsp;</strong>Scraping the Indeed Resume database or using the Indeed Resume database for any other purpose except as allowed will result in legal action being taken against you. Additionally, if you are a competitor of Indeed (including but not limited to any job aggregation website or any job posting websites) you may not use the Indeed Resume database to contact a Resume Owner for the purpose of sending them a job offer from your clients, and any such competitive use of the Indeed Resume database may result in Indeed blocking you from the Site, blocking you from contacting Indeed Resume Owners, and blocking your contact emails to those resume owners without notice and you consent to the same. Each Resume subscription is solely for the individual use of the person to whom it is assigned, and may not be shared with other users.</p> 
        <p><strong>In the event phone numbers are provided by the Job Seeker in the resume, Indeed does not guarantee their validity and can not confirm whether such numbers are landlines or cell phones. You agree to call Job Seekers regarding relevant job opportunities only. It is your sole responsibility to comply with all TCPA guidelines, including laws against automated telephone dialing systems.</strong></p> 
        <p><strong>2. Cancellation</strong></p> 
        <p>Once you have requested that Indeed contact a Resume Owner, you may not revoke such request. Cancellation of your use of the IRP shall be in accordance with any cancellation policies listed on the Site.</p> 
        <p><strong>3. Your Information</strong></p> 
        <p>You represent and warrant that all information you provide to Indeed is correct and current. You represent to Indeed that you are an Employer interested in considering the Resume Owner as a potential employee.</p> 
        <p><strong>4. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</strong></p> 
        <p>INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY THAT ANY EMAIL ADDRESS THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO INDEED IS VALID, THAT ANY EMAIL SENT BY INDEED AT YOUR REQUEST WILL REACH THE INTENDED RECIPIENT, THAT ANY INTENDED RECIPIENT OF ANY SUCH EMAIL WILL READ SUCH EMAIL, OR THAT ANY SUCH INTENDED RECIPIENT WILL ACT UPON SUCH EMAIL. INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p> 
        <p>EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 HEREUNDER AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTION 1, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE IRP TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE IRP TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU FOR THE INDEED RESUME SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p> 
        <p><strong>5. Payment</strong></p> 
        <p>You shall be charged if, and as, indicated by the Site.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Details regarding the resume subscription plan are available on the Site.</span><b>&nbsp;</b>If your billing address is in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US Dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the <a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#asiaPacificList">Asia-Pacific Region*</a>, you may only pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and US Dollars. If your billing address is anywhere else, you may be able to pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euros, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, or Japanese Yen. This choice of currencies will be fully subject to Indeed’s discretion. Charges are exclusive of taxes, including VAT. You are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODIC ALLOTMENTS UNDER THE APPLICABLE RESUME SUBSCRIPTION PLAN. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of credit for Indeed services. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore.

        <p><strong>6. Indemnification</strong></p>

        <p>These Indeed Ads Program Terms (“IAP Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the <a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#tos">Indeed Terms of Service</a> (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Ads Program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these Indeed Ads Program Terms.</p> 
        <p>Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IAP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</p> 
        <p><strong>1. The Program</strong></p> 
        <p>Use of the Indeed Ads Program (“Program”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy (<a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy">http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy</a>) and those instructions provided on the Website, if you are using the Ads Program, through our on-line forms. Indeed policies may be modified at any time. With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed, either for payment or posted for free and including jobs provided to Indeed via an XML feed (“Job Listings” or “Job Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content (including job descriptions and screener questions) and target URLs (“Creative”), whether generated by or for you, including but not limited to photograph(s) you provide to Indeed; and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”). You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own and any third party’s use of your accounts. Job Ads may be placed on (y) any content, service, or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”), and (z) any other content or property provided by a third party (“Publisher”) upon which Indeed places Job Ads or provides search results of Job Listings (“Publisher Property”). Indeed does not guarantee performance or placement of Job Ads, and distribution on Indeed and Publisher Properties may vary depending on demand, industry, sponsorship, and other considerations. <span style="color: #333333;">By sponsoring a Job Ad, you are agreeing to&nbsp;pay a price for each user “click” that such an ad receives. By sponsoring a Job Ad you are requesting that Indeed manage the placement of your Job Ads&nbsp;in the Indeed Search Engine Results Page to give your job prominence, in a way designed to make the experience on Indeed better for you and get your jobs better visibility. “Prominence” does not always mean the Job Ad will get a higher spot on the page, or that it will be called out with special wording, but means that it will be placed by Indeed in accordance with Indeed judgment and discretion in order to achieve what Indeed determines, in its sole discretion, to be the best positioning for such a job, considering the budget. By sponsoring a job you are requesting Indeed to manage this relative placement and positioning on its search engine results page.&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that such management and placement and&nbsp;positioning&nbsp;of sponsored Job Ads&nbsp;is in Indeed’s sole discretion and is provided without warranty as to how and where Indeed shall place such Job Ads. </span>You shall direct only to Indeed any communications regarding Job Ads on Publisher Properties. By posting or sponsoring a Job Ad on Indeed, including but not limited to by XML feed: you agree that Indeed may and authorize Indeed to reformat and host (but not change the content of) the Job Ad on an Indeed hosted page or in its publisher network in any way Indeed sees fit. All dashboards will reflect the total click count, including the clicks that open an Indeed reformatted or hosted page. In the event you provide Indeed with an indication that you are looking to fill your role in a short time period, as determined by Indeed, Indeed may add a label (such as “Urgent”, “Urgently Hiring” or similar) next to the word “Sponsored” on the search results page where your Job Ad is displayed. Indeed may use words or phrases interchangeably (for example, “Ad”, “Urgently Hiring”, “Paid”, “Promoted”, “Sponsored”, “Urgent” or similar) in connection with a sponsored advertisement on Indeed. Job Ads posted directly on Indeed may no longer appear on the Site after a certain period of time; in some cases, these Job Ads may need to be sponsored in order to remain visible or become visible again. However, Job Ads indexed by Indeed will expire after a certain period of time and Indeed is unable to restore their visibility. Please note that Job Ads may expire between the time you submit your application and from the time it is received. Indeed has no responsibility for expired Job Ads or for delivering applications prior to a Job Ad’s expiration. Indeed may require sponsorship for the display of any Job Ad at any time for any reason. Indeed may recommend or suggest a budget for any Job Ad to maintain its visibility. The suggestion is made without warranty and is not a guarantee regarding placement or visibility of any Job Ad. If you are located in Japan, you acknowledge that Indeed’s content moderation policies may, in certain instances, result in the modification of your Job Ad, and you agree to this activity.<span style="color: #de350b;">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #333333;">If you are an Indeed agency partner, you may be eligible&nbsp;to participate in an&nbsp;Indeed partnership</span> program. Agency partners in this program may attain the rank of “Gold”, “Silver”, or “Bronze” based on their Indeed usage and engagement, measured by revenue. Indeed’s determination of an agency’s rank is made at Indeed’s full discretion and may be revoked at any time. Indeed may offer certain Employers who sponsor Job Ads the opportunity to be displayed more prominently on the Site (“Featured Employer”). Featured Employer is awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion. The ability to receive Featured Employer, generally, is a function of both the number of open jobs at your company and how much you spend. A Featured Employer may also receive subscriptions to the Indeed Resume Program for a limited time (“Resume Rewards”), which are awarded at Indeed’s sole discretion. The Featured Employer program and Resume Rewards may be changed or removed by Indeed at any time, at Indeed’s sole discretion.</p> 
        <p><strong>2. Cancellation</strong></p> 
        <p>Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any advertisement at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours). Indeed may immediately cancel the Program or these IAP Terms at any time upon notice. Indeed may modify the Program or these IAP Terms at any time without liability and your use of the Program after notice that these IAP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IAP Terms. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IAP Terms.</p> 
        <p><strong>3. Prohibited Uses</strong></p> 
        <p>You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to: (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions or clicks; or (b) advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country where your advertisement is displayed. You represent and warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current; (y) you hold and grant Indeed and Publishers all rights to copy, distribute and display Creative (“Use”); and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws. Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IAP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences.&nbsp;<i>Indeed or Publishers may reject or remove any Job Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.&nbsp;Although Indeed may indicate why a job or account has been removed or disabled, we cannot give every reason why a job or a company may be removed, and we always retain the right to remove any job, organic or sponsored, if we feel it is in our interest or our users’ interest. For examples of why Indeed may reject such Job Ads from Employers, refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://indeedemployers.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000131823-Search-Quality">Indeed’s Search Quality Policies</a>. Indeed may require certain Job Ads to be sponsored in order to verify the legitimacy of the Job Ad and/or the Employer, to prevent abuse of the free to post system, to improve our services, or for any other reason in Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed may also limit the number of free Job Ads you are allowed to post at a given time in Indeed’s sole discretion. For example, we may require you to sponsor the following types of Job Ads: identical jobs posted in multiple locations, jobs posted with a confidential or generic company name, jobs that are commission only, hard-to-fill jobs, jobs posted by a staffing agency, recruitment process outsourcer, or other recruitment-based company, and any other jobs as determined by Indeed. Additionally, Indeed may choose not to accept an employer’s XML feed or any Job Ads in an XML feed for any or no reason. If you are a job board, Indeed reserves the right to include or reject any or all of your Job Ads. For examples of why Indeed may stop accepting such Job Ads from job boards, refer to the <a href="https://indeedemployers.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204575734-Job-Board-Inclusion-Guidelines">Job Board Inclusion Guidelines</a>. <span style="font-weight: 400;">As a job board, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you may only post Job Ads on the Site for your own company; you may not post Job Ads on the Site for your client</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s and if you do or attempt to do so, Indeed reserves the right to disable your account. </span></i>You acknowledge that inclusion of jobs in violation of these guidelines on the Indeed Site may harm Indeed and its users.&nbsp;</i>When you create an Indeed account, Indeed may require that you verify your identity through a third party service called Mitek. By using Mitek, you are submitting your identification documents for verification directly to Mitek you are agreeing to share your identification with Mitek, and you agree that Mitek is solely responsible for any use or loss of data. Indeed may have access to your identification documents via Mitek.</p> 
        <p><strong>4. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</strong></p> 
        <p>INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. Indeed and its affiliates, and its and their third-party licensors, disclaim all guarantees regarding positioning or the levels or timing of: (i) costs per click, (ii) click through rates, (iii) delivery of any impressions on any Publisher Property or Indeed Property or sections of such properties, (iv) clicks, (v) conversions for any Creative, or (vi) interest in your Job Listing.&nbsp;The aforementioned disclaimers apply regardless of whether a Job Listing appears on desktop or mobile.<strong>&nbsp;</strong> CLICKS ARE ANONYMOUS AND INDEED HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR CONFIRMING A USER’S IDENTITY. A CLICK ON YOUR JOB LISTING DOES NOT GUARANTEE INTEREST IN SUCH JOB LISTING. EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 HEREUNDER, AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTION 1, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE IAP TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE IAP TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU FOR THE JOB ADS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p> 
        <p><strong>5. Payment</strong></p> 
        <p>You shall be charged based on click count, regardless of whether you set a total budget. If you are located in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the <a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#asiaPacificList">Asia-Pacific Region*</a>, you may only pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and US Dollars.

Indeed’s determination of click count shall be binding.</strong>&nbsp;Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of advertising credit for Indeed Property.&nbsp;If you are removed from Indeed, but have previously spent on Indeed, you are not entitled to a refund of previously spent amounts.&nbsp;You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims.

All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefor. Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail.

        <p>These Indeed Publisher Program Terms (“IPP Terms”) apply to any Publisher that accesses or uses the Indeed Publisher Program, or that otherwise indicates its acceptance of these IPP Terms.</p> 
        <p>These IPP Terms are between You and Indeed, Inc., 6433 Champion Grandview Way, Building 1, Austin, TX, 78750, USA, and set out the terms and conditions applicable to your participation in the Indeed Publisher Program (the “Program”) and, along with Indeed Terms of Service, use of or access to Indeed’s online and/or mobile services and websites, and software provided by or on behalf of Indeed on or in connection with such services or websites (collectively, the “Site”). Any references to “Indeed” shall mean Indeed, Inc. The Program, as generally offered by Indeed, is described on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indeed.com/publisher">https://www.indeed.com/publisher</a>&nbsp;or such other URL as Indeed may provide from time to time. “You” or “Publisher” means any entity identified in an enrollment form submitted by the same or affiliated persons, and/or any agency or network acting on its (or their) behalf, which shall also be bound by these IPP Terms.</p> 
        <p>These IPP Terms hereby incorporate by this reference any additional terms and conditions posted by Indeed through the Site, or otherwise made available to you by Indeed, including the <a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#tos">Indeed Terms of Service</a>.</p> 
        <p>Indeed shall have absolute discretion as to whether or not it accepts a particular applicant or site for participation in the Program or any part thereof. Publishers are ineligible to participate if their web properties do not conform with the terms of the Indeed Affiliate Acceptable Use Policy, located online at <a href="https://ads.indeed.com/jobroll/aaup.jsp">AAUP</a> (the “AAUP”). In order to participate as a publisher in the Program, all participants must be at least eighteen years of age.

The Indeed Logo Image can be found at: <a href="http://www.indeed.com/p/jobsearch.gif">http://www.indeed.com/p/jobsearch.gif</a>.</p> 
        <p>Publisher agrees to abide by all terms of the AAUP. Indeed reserves the right in its sole discretion to suspend Publisher’s participation in the Program if it suspects any violations of the AAUP. Publisher hereby agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Indeed harmless from and against any claims, demands, liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and attorney fees arising from or relating to a violation or purported violation by Publisher of the AAUP. The foregoing shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies that Indeed may have as a result of a violation of the AAUP by Publisher. In addition, under no circumstances may Publisher impersonate or act as Indeed on any site (which shall include bidding on Indeed’s names or trademarks in any search engine marketing advertising platform), including, but not limited to, on third party sites. Any marketing performed by Publisher must comply with all laws of the jurisdiction in which the marketing is conducted, including but not limited to email, text messaging and general advertising laws, and Publisher agrees to defend and indemnify Indeed from any third party action, claim, or demand against Indeed arising from any violation of those laws.&nbsp;</p> 
        <p>Publisher hereby grants Indeed permission to refer to Publisher and its websites in Indeed’s marketing materials, wherever such marketing materials shall appear.</p> 
        <p><strong>2. Payments to Publisher</strong></p> 
        <p>Publisher shall receive a commission payment with respect to valid clicks received (as determined solely by Indeed and subject to any cap amounts determined solely by Indeed) in relation to Program Elements displayed on Accepted URLs. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, IN EACH CASE, THE AMOUNT OF SUCH COMMISSION PAYMENT WILL BE DETERMINED SOLELY BY INDEED, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>AND THAT SUCH COMMISSION AMOUNT MAY BE SUBJECT TO A CAP, ALSO TO BE DETERMINED BY INDEED IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME. You also acknowledge and agree that any billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors, solely for the purposes of effecting payment to You&nbsp;and servicing your account. Publisher shall not be compensated for any transactions generated by Publisher or any party acting on Publisher’s behalf. In addition, Indeed shall not be obligated to pay for any artificial and/or fraudulent impressions or clicks as determined by Indeed or if Publisher is in breach of these IPP Terms. In addition and not in limitation to the above, Publisher shall refund the share of that revenue paid to Publisher, if caused by artificial or fraudulent impressions. These IPP Terms may not be amended, except in writing, in a separate document specifically referencing these terms, and signed by representatives of both parties. Email exchanges shall not amend these IPP Terms. No dashboard or any other view of any click count shall be considered as contractually binding on Indeed.&nbsp;All commission amounts may be subject to an overall commission cap, in Indeed’s sole discretion, and subject to change at any time.</p> 
        <p><strong>3. Qualifying Links</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of March 3, 2017, the below portion of the IPP will no longer be available to any new Publisher. As of March&nbsp;31, 2017, the below portion of the IPP will no longer be available to any Publisher, including existing Publishers who are part of the IPP.</span></p> 
        <p>[Publisher may earn a commission, as determined by Indeed in its sole discretion, if Publisher refers a Qualified User (as defined below) to the Indeed Website via a Qualifying Link (as defined below) and if such Qualified User has accessed the Indeed Website and purchased a qualifying product or service (“Qualifying Purchase”) during a Session (as defined below). Not all services or products will be eligible as a Qualifying Purchase under the Program, and Qualifying Purchases are determined in Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed is under no obligation to pay any particular amount for any referral and it is in Indeed’s absolute discretion to determine for how long a period of time it shall pay this commission after the date the Qualified User initially arrives at Indeed via a Qualifying Link from the Publisher’s Publisher Property (“Initial Contact’). No payments under this program shall be any indication of future payments under this program.</p> 
        <p>A “Qualifying Link” is a link directing a Qualified User from Publisher’s website or online property (“Publisher Property”) to Indeed using a Program Element provided by Indeed for use with the Program. A “Session” is the period of time beginning when a Qualified User initially arrives at Indeed via a Qualifying Link from the Publisher’s Publisher Property (“Initial Contact”), and ending at Indeed’s absolute discretion. For avoidance of doubt, Publisher acknowledges that a Session will not commence unless cookies are enabled on the Customer’s device or computer in a manner that enables Indeed to fully attribute actions of Qualified User to Publisher’s Qualifying Link. A “Qualified User” is a user who has not previously registered with Indeed, has not been previously “cookied” by Indeed and has not previously visited the Indeed Site, all as determined by Indeed in its sole and absolute discretion.</p> 
        <p>The parties acknowledge and agree that Indeed shall have the sole right and responsibility for processing all orders made by Qualified Users. Publisher acknowledges that all agreements relating to sales to Qualified Users shall be between Indeed and the Qualified User.]</p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of March&nbsp;31, 2017, the following will be the only available method for participation in the IPP:</span></p> 
        <p>[Publisher may earn a commission, as determined by Indeed in its sole discretion, if a user clicks on a Qualifying Link. A “Qualifying Link” is a link directing a user from the Publisher’s website or online property (“Publisher Property”) to a job using a Program Element provided by Indeed for use with the Program, such as pay-per-click advertising, Jobroll™, or job search results.]</p> 
        <p>Publisher shall not be entitled to commissions and shall reverse any commissions already paid if Publisher is in breach of these IPP Terms or has engaged in any fraudulent activity, including, but not limited to, cookie stuffing, cloaking, or forcing pop-ups.The determination as to whether a sale is made via a Qualifying Link, and whether a commission is payable, will be made by Indeed in its sole and absolute discretion and is final and binding on Publisher. Prices for the Qualifying Purchases will be set solely by Indeed in its sole and absolute discretion.</p> 
        <p><strong>4. Terms of Payment</strong></p> 
        <p>Indeed shall pay Publisher within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter; provided the amount owing to Publisher is at least one hundred US dollars ($100). If the amount owing to Publisher is less than $100, the balance will carry over to subsequent calendar quarters until such time that the quarter-end balance is at least one hundred US dollars ($100). Publisher is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with Publisher Account. Indeed may withhold any and all payment if Publisher is in breach of these IPP Terms and Indeed shall have no further liability to Publisher.</p> 
        <p><strong>5. Termination</strong></p> 
        <p>Either party may terminate these IPP Terms and participation in the Program at any time by sending a notice by email to support-at-indeed dot com or other email address specified by Indeed in the case of Indeed, and to the email address specified in Publisher’s profile in the Program in the case of Publisher.</p> 
        <p>Upon termination of a publisher from the Program, for any reason and by either party, Publisher shall immediately remove all insertion codes and other Program Elements from all pages of its websites.</p> 
        <p><strong>6. Confidentiality</strong></p> 
        <p>Publisher shall not disclose Indeed Confidential Information without Indeed’s prior written consent. “Indeed Confidential Information” includes without limitation: (a) all Indeed software, technology, programming, specifications, materials, guidelines and documentation relating to the Program; (b) click-through rates or other performance statistics relating to the Program provided to Publisher by Indeed; and (c) any other information designated in writing by Indeed as “Confidential” or an equivalent designation.</p> 
        <p><strong>7. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</strong></p> 
        <p>INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND PROGRAM ELEMENTS (THE “SERVICE”) AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR LICENSORS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NEITHER INDEED NOR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR LICENSORS, MAKE ANY WARRANTY THAT (i) THE SERVICE OR SITE WILL MEET PUBLISHER’S REQUIREMENTS; (ii) THE SERVICE OR ACCESS TO THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE; (iii) THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR SITE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE; OR (iv) ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICE OR SITE WILL BE CORRECTED.</p> 
        <p>NEITHER INDEED NOR ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR LICENSORS, SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES INCURRED BY PUBLISHER FROM PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT (INCLUDING FUNDAMENTAL BREACH), TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE. IN NO EVENT SHALL INDEED’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES THEN DUE TO PUBLISHER AS DETERMINED PURSUANT TO THESE IPP TERMS.</p> 
        <p><strong>8. Miscellaneous</strong></p> 
        <p>These IPP Terms (including the Indeed Terms of Service incorporated herein) constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Indeed Publisher Program and supersede and replace all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any provision of these IPP Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Indeed. These IPP Terms, together with any amendments thereto and any additional agreements you may enter into with Indeed in connection with the Site, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Indeed concerning the Site. In the event of any irreconcilable conflict between these IPP Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service, these IPP Terms will govern with respect to the Indeed Publisher Program, and the Indeed Terms of Service will otherwise govern. If any provision of these IPP Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these IPP Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Indeed Assessments Terms (“IA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the </span><a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#tos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the “Agreement”). By using Indeed Assessments in any way, or by registering as a Candidate or an Employer on Indeed Assessments, you agree to these Indeed Assessments Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement. The term “You” refers to the Candidate or the Employer in accordance with the context of the sentence.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;</span><strong>Introduction</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed Assessments is an online tool for the provision and review of certain skills assessments selected by Employers (“Assessments”) and responses from Candidates (“Responses”) through the Site. </span></p> 
        <p><strong>2. Assessments</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to use Indeed Assessments as a Candidate you must create an Indeed Assessments account or log in using your preexisting Indeed Assessments account. Account information you submit through the Site is subject to the Indeed Terms of Service and to Indeed’s Privacy Policy. Employers may use the Indeed Assessments tool to send you Assessments, to which you may provide Responses. Indeed may also offer you the option to select an Assessment to complete independent of a particular job, and your Response will be associated with your Indeed profile. You may choose whether the Response is available to Employers viewing your Indeed profile, though Indeed will count the Response for purposes of generating aggregate Response statistics even if Your Response is hidden. An Assessment only evaluates a particular skill. It does not evaluate a Candidate’s qualification for any job. Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Candidate is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by the Employer sending the Assessment and reviewing your Response.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge and understand that Indeed does not choose the Assessments sent by Employers and has no control over Employers’ selection or use of Assessments. You agree that the questions in any Assessment are solely being asked by the Employer sending the Assessment and are not being asked by Indeed. </span><b>You further agree that Indeed is not responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act, and that the responsibility for offering any such alternative method lies solely with Employers.</b> <b>If you require an accommodation, or any alternative method(s) of Assessment, screening or application, you must indicate it to the Employer.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent state act.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiving or responding to an Assessment does not guarantee a job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary, or any further communication or action by any Employer.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that any Assessment sent by Indeed to a Candidate is done so at your sole request, and you represent and warrant that you have that Candidate’s consent for Indeed to contact that Candidate for the purpose of transmitting the Assessment(s) you have selected. You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Assessment to a Candidate, that request cannot be canceled. Indeed does not guarantee that any Candidate will receive, access, read or respond to any Assessment, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree you have made the determination to use Indeed Assessments as part of your application process, and that the types of questions asked in any Assessment or bundle of Assessments you send to a Candidate are solely being asked by you and are not being asked by Indeed. You agree you are solely responsible for the use of Assessments and Responses in compliance with the law, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state statutes. You are solely responsible for your use of Indeed Assessments, including without limitation any results which are considered to have a “disparate impact.” </span><b>You further agree that you are solely responsible for offering alternative methods of screening, if so required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any other equivalent state act.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You acknowledge that Indeed may, but is not obligated to, provide a means by which Candidates may request such an alternative method or other accommodation from you. Indeed does not warrant that the method of delivery of any Assessment question would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act or any equivalent state act.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that an Assessment only evaluates a particular skill. It does not evaluate a Candidate’s qualification for any job. Whether a particular skill is relevant to a job, or whether a Candidate is qualified or appropriate for a job, is decided solely by you. You are the sole party to determine which Assessment to send to any Candidate. Indeed reserves the right to change any Assessment or the questions asked within an Assessment at any time, for any or no reason, including but not limited to quality control.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending an Assessment to a Candidate does not guarantee a Response or any further communication or action by any Candidate. You consent to your Assessment and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s Privacy Policy.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>3. Responses</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Candidate may, but is not required to, provide a Response to an Assessment sent by an Employer. After a Candidate has provided a Response, the Employer will be able to use the Indeed Assessments platform to review the Response. A candidate may also have the option to select an Assessment and associate the Response with their Indeed profile, which will be visible to Employers in accordance with our Terms. If there are multiple versions of the same Assessment, the Response percentile for any Candidate will be determined only in relation to other Responses to the same version of that Assessment.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Candidate, you consent to your Responses, applications, and any other communications sent through Indeed Assessments being processed and analyzed by Indeed according to this Agreement and Indeed’s <a href="https://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. </span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a Candidate, you are requesting and authorizing Indeed to make your Response available to the Employer providing the Assessment, or (in the case of Assessments selected by You) to any Employer viewing Your Indeed profile. You understand that this is without warranty, and that Indeed reserves the right to display or reformat Responses in a manner to permit Employers to review your Response together with Responses from other Candidates. Indeed may aggregate the results of all Candidate-selected Assessments for the purpose of displaying the percentile for Your Response. You also acknowledge that once you have requested that Indeed transmit your Response to an Employer, that request cannot be canceled. Indeed does not guarantee that any Employer will receive, access, read or respond to any Response, or that there will be no mistakes in the transmission of the data. However, Indeed may alert you when any of the above events occur. </span></p> 
        <p>An Employer is the sole party to determine whether a Response indicates a qualified candidate. Employers may have instructed Indeed to send out rejection notices if you have have not responded to Assessments in a manner acceptable to the Employer, and you acknowledge that Indeed has no discretion in the transmission of these rejections. The Employer is the sole party to determine whether to give you the opportunity to retake any Assessment sent by that Employer or update or modify your Response.</p> 
        <p><strong>4. Rules For Using Indeed Assessments</strong></p> 
        <p>Whether you are a Candidate or Employer, you represent and warrant that you shall not access or use Indeed Assessments for any directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, or fraudulent purpose. You shall not create or send any Assessment or Response which is directly or indirectly illegal, discriminatory, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable, or that contains sexual, ethnic, racial or other discriminating slurs, or that contains no relevant or constructive content. You shall not create or send any Assessment or Response containing proprietary information, trade secrets, confidential information, advertisements, solicitations, chain letters, pyramid schemes, investment opportunities, or other unsolicited commercial communication (except as otherwise expressly permitted by us in writing).</p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers may not create or send any Assessment which seeks highly confidential personal information from Candidates, such as bank account or credit card information, online account information, social security numbers (or similar counterparts outside the United States of America), health information, or other categories of data subject to special breach notification requirements in any country. Candidates may not create or send any Response which contains any such highly confidential personal information.</span></p> 
        <p><b><i>Whether you are a Candidate or Employer, you understand and agree that Indeed does not have any obligation to screen any Assessment or Response, or to include any Assessment or Response in the Site, and may exclude or remove any Assessment or Response from the Site for any or no reason without liability or notice.</i></b></p> 
        <p><strong>5. Indeed’s Role</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed does not act as an employment agency by offering the Indeed Assessments tool. By using Indeed Assessments, you acknowledge and agree that Indeed is not procuring employees for Employers or procuring opportunities to work for Candidates. Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Employers and Candidates to exchange Assessments and Responses as they determine. The sole responsibility for the content of any Assessment or Response, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Indeed Assessments, is solely with Employers or Candidates as applicable.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed cannot confirm the information submitted by any Employer, Candidate, or other user, including the identity of any user. Indeed does not inquire into the backgrounds of Candidates or Employers or attempt to verify the statements of Candidates or Employers. You are responsible for conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Candidate or accepting an offer of employment from an Employer. You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate. If you are a Candidate, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries, may only be asserted against the Employer. Further, for any skill area in which formal licenses or certifications may exist, Assessments do not act as a substitute for such license or certification and do not speak to whether a Candidate is qualified for or has such a license or certification. It is the Employer’s sole responsibility to determine what licenses or certifications are required for their job and whether a Candidate has such license or certification. Indeed also makes no statement as to whether a particular skill is necessary for a job and it is an Employer’s sole responsibility to make such determination (or seek appropriate legal counsel to do so), in accordance with the EEOC or other applicable laws.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed is not a third party to or liable for any agreements between an Employer and Candidate, regardless of whether or not Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction. Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed assumes no responsibility, and disclaims all liability, for the content, accuracy, validity, completeness, legality, reliability, or availability of the Site, the Indeed Assessments tool, and any Assessment or Response.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>6. Fees</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed Assessments is free for Candidates. &nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed Assessments is currently free for Employers.&nbsp;Indeed may, in its sole discretion and at any time, end Employers’ free use of Indeed Assessments and begin to charge Employers to use Indeed Assessments as a standalone product or in conjunction with an Employer’s use of any other Indeed product.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>7. Confidentiality</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree and acknowledge that the usefulness and value of Assessments and Responses depend on their contents being kept confidential. You therefore agree to keep the content of Assessments and Responses confidential and to not reproduce or discuss them with anyone, except that you may communicate with an Employer about an Assessment they have sent to you and your Response. </span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to keep all information gained from using Indeed Assessments confidential. You agree that (1) you will use any content submitted by Candidates only in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws; (2) you will not disclose the names or identities or share the profile of any Candidates outside of your recruiting or hiring department; and (3) you will take appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to protect content you obtain through use of Indeed Assessments from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. </span></p> 
        <p><strong>8.&nbsp;Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">INDEED ASSESSMENTS AND ALL MATERIALS, INFORMATION, ASSESSMENTS, RESPONSES, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH INDEED ASSESSMENTS, ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. &nbsp;INDEED EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTY THAT ANY ASSESSMENT OR RESPONSE THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO INDEED IS VALID OR ACCURATE, THAT ANY COMMUNICATION (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ASSESSMENTS AND RESPONSES) WILL REACH THE INTENDED RECIPIENT, THAT THE INTENDED RECIPIENT OF THE COMMUNICATION SENT AT YOUR REQUEST WILL READ IT, OR THAT THE INTENDED RECIPIENT OF YOUR COMMUNICATION WILL ACT UPON IT. INDEED EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. INDEED DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY THAT INDEED ASSESSMENTS WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED.</span></p> 
        <p>EXCEPT FOR YOUR BREACH OF SECTION 7 (CONFIDENTIALITY) OR INDEMNIFICATION AMOUNTS PAYABLE HEREUNDER, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU.</p> 
        <p><strong>9.&nbsp;Indemnification</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Indeed from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (a) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (b) your use of, and access to, Indeed Assessments or the Site; (c) your loss of, or disclosure of, information gained from using Indeed Assessments or the Site; (d) your violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, any applicable employment, equality, or discrimination laws, and any applicable data protection or privacy laws; (e) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; (f) any claim that your content caused damage to a third party; or (g) your actions as an Employer, including without limitation doing or not doing the following: screening, hiring, promoting, or demoting any employee or Candidate. You also agree that you have a duty to defend Indeed against such claims. You agree that this indemnity extends to requiring you to pay for Indeed’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, settlements and disbursements. This defense and indemnification obligation will survive this Agreement and your use of Indeed Assessments.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>10. Termination</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed may suspend Indeed Assessments, the Site, your account, or any other provision of tools to you, and we may terminate this Agreement with you, at our sole discretion, at any time, with or without notice. If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by notifying Indeed at any time and closing your account. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. &nbsp;</span></p>

        <p>Last Updated: September 13, 2019</p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Seen by Indeed Terms (“Seen Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the </span><a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#tos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the “Agreement”). By using Seen by Indeed (“Seen”) in any way, or by registering as a Candidate or an Employer on Seen, you agree to these Seen by Indeed Terms and the Indeed Terms of Service.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these IP Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement. The term “You” refers to the Candidate, the Employer or the Referrer, as per the context of the sentence.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seen by Indeed (“Seen”) is an online tool that allows Seen Employers (“Employers”) to connect with Candidate Job Seekers (“Candidates”). The term “Candidate” will refer to users of Seen who are seeking employment opportunities through Seen. The term “Employer” will refer to a company that is interested in using the Seen online tool to evaluate Candidates for employment.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users who wish to participate in Seen as a Candidate or Employer must first apply as detailed below. Not all users who apply to Seen will be accepted into the program, though all users who apply to Seen will remain within the Seen database regardless of acceptance, subject to our Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates accepted by Indeed will be entered into the Seen Talent List of Candidates (“List”). Employers accepted by Seen may use the Seen tool to review Candidates in the List. Employers may choose to interview Candidates from the List and conduct a hiring process with such Candidate if they wish. There is a charge for use of this tool to the Employers, as set forth below. There is no charge to Candidates.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>2. Applying to Seen by Indeed</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidate:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to use Seen as a Candidate you must create an Indeed account or login using your preexisting Indeed account, create a profile, and apply. When applying to Seen, we may require you to provide us with additional information, such as your name, email address, phone number, skill set, salary requirements and geographic location. At this stage, you may have the opportunity to block your profile from certain Employers, though Indeed cannot guarantee that such Employers will never be able to view your Seen profile. We will use the information that you provide us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Seen by Indeed. You agree that such a determination may be made on the basis of automated decision making. We may use a third party vendor to help us review your application. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to use Seen.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are accepted into Seen, we will notify you via email. Once you have been accepted, a member of the Seen Talent Team (“Talent Consultant”) may reach out to you via the email address or phone number you provided, and work with you to finalize your Candidate profile. Please note that although Seen may suggest ways to help highlight your qualifications, you retain responsibility for the content, truth, and accuracy of your profile. The Talent Consultant may continue to work with you throughout your time on Seen.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not accepted into Seen, you will be notified via email and your profile will remain within the Seen database as a private, non-searchable profile, which may be sent to Employers that Seen believes may be interested in you.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employer:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to use Seen as an Employer you must also apply. Applying to be an Employer is free. When applying we may ask you for additional information related to your company, including but not limited to, your name, email address, company URL, phone number and geographic location. We will review the information that you provided to us during the application process to determine whether you will be accepted into Seen. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to accept or reject your application to Seen. If your application is accepted, you will be notified via email and allowed to use the Seen online tool so as to engage with, and reach out to Candidates that are available in the Seen List.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>3. Talent List</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a Candidate has applied and been accepted to Seen, he or she will be placed into the List to be viewed by Employers using the Seen tool. Candidates will remain in the List for such a time as determined by Indeed, as per Indeed rules. Employers will then have the opportunity to engage with Candidates in the List. Candidates may receive emails from Employers informing them of their interest in the Candidate, and providing them details about the job solicitation. Indeed has no input into the Employer’s selection process. Employers may be able to share Candidate profile information. A Candidate may, but is not required to, respond to any Employer that has contacted him or her. All requests for interviews by Employers through Seen do not guarantee a final job or job offer, or a job offer at any particular salary.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed may refer to Candidates in the List with certain descriptors such as “new,” “active,” or “passive,” which may be selected by the Candidate or may be based on the Candidate’s activity on Indeed. For example, if a Candidate stops using the Seen platform, after a period of time Indeed may label such a Candidate as “passive” until they use the Seen platform again. Some Employers may not be shown passive Candidates in search results, depending on the Employer’s subscription to Seen. In addition, Indeed may remove any Candidate from the List, at any time, for any reason, in Indeed’s sole discretion. A removed Candidate may reapply through their Talent Consultant for consideration to be reentered into the List. The re-application process is at Indeed’s sole discretion, and not all re-applications will be granted.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an Employer’s application has been accepted by Seen, the Employer will be able to use the Seen tool in order to browse the Candidates in the List, communicate with these Candidates, and submit interview requests to Candidates. Employer acknowledges and agrees that all Candidate information in the List is provided by Candidates only, and that Indeed cannot vouch for the accuracy or truth of Candidate profiles. Seen does not inquire into the backgrounds of Candidates or attempt to verify the identity or statements of Candidates. Employers are responsible for conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that may be required before making an offer of employment to a Candidate. Employers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate. No contractual obligations are created for either the Candidate or the Employer through the use of Seen. The Candidate is not obligated to accept any offer from an Employer that contacts them through Seen. Additionally, offers or interview requests submitted by an Employer to a Candidate through Seen are not binding on the Employer. Employer agrees that Indeed is entitled to publish the details of all non-binding offers made and the identity of those parties that have made such offers, unless the Employer has elected to remain anonymous. Indeed may associate Candidates in the List with certain descriptors such as “new,” “active,” or “passive,” or similar words. These descriptors may be selected by the Candidate or they may be based on a Candidate’s activity on Indeed, and do not guarantee a candidate’s interest level in any job or Employer.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employer agrees not to attempt to circumvent Seen by attempting to contact a Candidate through alternative means after discovering the Candidate on Seen.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed’s Role:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed does not act as an employment agent by providing the Seen product. Indeed merely provides a tool enabling Candidates and Employers to connect with each other. Candidates and Employers are solely responsible for the information provided in any resume or profile, any requests for interviews or offers made, any issues arising from an acceptance or denial of employment, and any other issues arising from the use of Seen.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand that Seen does not inquire into the backgrounds of Candidates or Employers or attempt to verify the statements of Candidates or Employers, and that you are responsible for (1) conducting any background checks, reference checks, or other due diligence that you may require before making an offer of employment to a Candidate or accepting an offer of employment from an Employer, and (2) complying with all laws and regulations relating to the intended employment of any Candidate. If you are a Candidate, you agree that any rights you have under any applicable employment, equality or discrimination laws, the US Fair Credit Reporting Act, any corresponding state laws, or any similar laws regulating consumer or credit reporting agencies in other countries may only be asserted against the Employer.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed is not a party to, beneficiary of, or liable for, any agreements between an Employer and Candidate, regardless of whether Indeed receives a fee from the Employer in connection with the transaction. You agree that Indeed will not be liable for any costs or damages arising out of or related to such transaction.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>4. Fees and Refunds</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates:</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seen by Indeed is free for Candidates.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seen by Indeed offers services to Employers under a subscription-based model (“Subscription Model”). The Subscription model offers three pricing plans offering varying features: Starter, Standard, and Professional. The determination of which pricing plan an Employer falls into is made at Indeed’s sole discretion at the time of signup (even if an Employer requests a different pricing plan).</span></p> 
        <ol> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Subscription Model, Employers agree to pay upfront an initial subscription fee for a period of time specified in any Indeed insertion order or online pricing page (each subscription period is a “Term”), if applicable. Each Employer is allocated a certain number of contacts with Seen Candidates based on the Employer’s pricing plan. Indeed may credit contacts to Employers from time to time in its sole discretion. Employers subscribed to different pricing plans may have different visibility levels with regard to Candidates. For example, employers using the Starter subscription may not be able to view candidates labeled as “Passive” in the Seen platform. The decision regarding which candidates to show in search results is made by Indeed in its sole discretion.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Starter Plan is currently free for Employers. Pricing for the Standard and Professional Plans will be indicated on the applicable Indeed insertion order or the Seen pricing page.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All plans under the Subscription Model will automatically renew for additional Terms, except where prohibited by applicable law. If you wish to cancel your Subscription, you must do so no later than 15 days prior to the end of any Term. No refunds will be given for payment made during any Term.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payment is due upon receipt of an insertion order or email confirming your purchase, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing with Indeed.</span></li> 
        </ol> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you wish to use the Seen tool, you must have an agreement with Indeed, Inc. or Indeed Ireland Operations Ltd. to do so under one of the pricing models listed above, and have accepted Indeed’s online Terms of Service. Taxes will be charged as applicable. The obligation to pay Fees shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>5. Referrals</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5(a) </strong>Indeed may offer “Candidate Referral Rewards” in the form of gift cards to individuals who refer a Candidate to Seen (the “Candidate Referrer”), if the conditions below are met. The currency and amount paid in the gift card with respect to all Candidate Referral Rewards will be determined by Indeed in its sole discretion, and will depend on the tax residence of the Candidate Referrer.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following conditions and limitations apply to any Candidate Referral Rewards:</span></p> 
        <ol> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Candidate referred by the Candidate Referrer must have: i) been accepted onto Seen by Indeed; ii) been contacted by an Employer through Seen; iii) been hired through Seen; and iv) graduated from their last school or university at least one year prior to the referral. (Neither a Candidate-initiated contact to an Employer, nor any Employer–Candidate contact initiated by Seen, will qualify as a Candidate’s being contacted by an Employer for purposes of rewards.) In addition, if such an eligible candidate is hired through Seen and works at the Employer for at least ninety days, additional Candidate Referral Rewards may be provided by Indeed. Seen may also in its sole discretion waive some of these requirements for certain Candidates referred and accepted onto the List.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a limit of 5 rewards per calendar year to any one Candidate Referrer.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be tax resident in the U.S., the U.K., Canada or Ireland. If you are tax resident in the U.S., in order to receive a Candidate Referral Reward, you must provide Indeed with a valid and completed W-9 document and ACH form. If you have not provided Indeed with a valid and completed W-9 and ACH form, you will receive no Candidate Referral Reward. If you are tax resident in the U.K., Canada or Ireland, in order to receive the Candidate Referral Reward, you must provide Indeed with your valid banking details upon request. If you are tax resident in the U.K., Canada or Ireland and make a referral for the U.S., in order to receive the Candidate Referral Reward, you must provide Indeed with a valid and completed W-8 document and your valid banking details upon request.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All payments to any Candidate Referrer, excluding Indeed employees, are gross amounts and the Candidate Referrer will be responsible for paying all applicable taxes on the reward.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed Employees only: The Candidate Referral Reward to be paid to any Indeed employee will be included in the employee’s paycheck in the period following the determination that the referred candidate meets the qualification for reward. The amount paid will be included in the employee W-2 form at the end of the year. The reward will be paid net of tax. Employees must contact their tax advisors to determine the proper treatment at the time of filing their personal income tax returns.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program may be cancelled at any time without notice; all referrals made prior to program cancellation will be paid in the event the above conditions are satisfied.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed has the right to refuse any referred candidate participation in the Seen program for any reason.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No reward will be paid for any referred candidate who is already a member of Seen when the referral was received.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You represent to Seen that there is no contractual barrier to receiving a Candidate Referral Reward.</span></li> 
        </ol> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5(b)</strong> Indeed will also offer “Employer Referral Rewards” in the form of a $500 (USD) gift card if in the U.S., a £500 (GBP) gift card if in the U.K., a €500 (EUR) gift card if in Ireland, or a $500 (CAD) gift card if in Canada, to individuals who refer recruiters or hiring managers at other companies (the “Employer Referrer”) who subsequently join Seen and use Seen for at least three months (“Referred Employer”). The currency and amount paid in the gift card with respect to all Employer Referral Rewards will depend on the tax residence of the Employer Referrer. In addition, the following limitations apply:</span></p> 
        <ol> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed has the right to refuse any Referred Employer participation in the Seen program for any reason.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No award will be paid for any Referred Employer who is already a member of Seen or was a member of Seen in the 12 months previous to when the referral was received, or for any Referred Employer who fails to timely pay any invoices from their first three months of using Seen.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a limit of 5 rewards per calendar year to any one Employer Referrer.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be a tax resident of the U.S., U.K., Canada or Ireland.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are tax resident in the U.S., in order to receive the Employer Referral Reward, you must provide Indeed with a valid and completed W-9 document and ACH form. If you have not provided Indeed with a valid and completed W-9 and ACH form, you will receive no Employer Referral Reward. If you are a tax resident in the U.K., Canada or Ireland, in order to receive the Employer Referral Reward, you must provide Indeed with your valid banking details upon request. If you are tax resident in the U.K., Canada or Ireland resident and you make a referral for the U.S., in order to receive the Employer Referral Reward, you must provide Indeed with a valid and completed W-8 document and your valid banking details upon request.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All payments to any Employer Referrer are gross amounts and the Employer Referrer will be responsible for paying all applicable taxes on the reward.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program may be cancelled at any time without notice; all referrals made prior to program cancellation will be paid in the event the above conditions are satisfied.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed has the right to refuse any Referred Employer participation in the Seen program for any reason.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No reward will be paid for any Referred Employer who is already a member of Seen when the referral was received.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You represent to Seem that there is no contractual barrier to receiving an Employer Referral Reward.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed employees cannot refer or be referred and receive an Employer Referral Reward.</span></li> 
        </ol> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>5(c)</strong> Indeed will also offer the Seen Ambassador Program. To become a Seen Ambassador, you must apply and be accepted into the Seen Ambassador Program. Applicants represent and warrant that all information submitted to Indeed is true, accurate and complete. Indeed shall have absolute discretion as to whether or not it accepts a particular applicant for participation in the Program or any part thereof. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are accepted as a Seen Ambassador, we will notify you via email. Please note that certain aspects of the Seen Ambassador Program may be managed by a service provider or other third party. Such service provider may display information and statistics regarding the Ambassador Program, but the final determination of such information will be made by Indeed. For example, the service provider may provide a dashboard showing the current number of Candidate referrals, but the final number of such referrals is subject to revision due to factors such as the discovery of duplicates, incorrect information, fraud, or other reasons determined by Indeed.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed reserves the right in its sole discretion to suspend any Ambassador’s participation in the Program if Indeed suspects any violations of these Terms. As an Ambassador, you agree to defend and indemnify Indeed from any third party action, claim, or demand against Indeed arising from your participation in the Program, including but not limited to any breach of these Terms or any breach of applicable law. The foregoing shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies that Indeed may have as a result of a violation of these Terms by an Ambassador.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following rules also apply to the Seen Ambassador Program:</span></p> 
        <ol> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All participants must be at least eighteen years of age.&nbsp;</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambassadors may only participate in the Program if they clearly identify themselves as Seen Ambassadors. Under no circumstances may an Ambassador impersonate or act as Indeed on any site (which shall include bidding on Indeed’s names or trademarks in any search engine marketing advertising platform), including, but not limited to, on third party sites. Any marketing activity performed by an Ambassador must comply with all laws of the jurisdiction in which the marketing is conducted.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambassadors may not conduct any text message or SMS-based marketing in connection with the Seen Ambassador Program.&nbsp;</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambassadors in good standing and in compliance with these Terms will receive a commission payment of twenty-five US dollars ($25) with respect to each Candidate referred by the Ambassador and accepted into the Seen program. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH COMMISSION AMOUNT MAY BE SUBJECT TO A CAP, TO BE DETERMINED BY INDEED IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME. You also acknowledge and agree that any billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors, solely for the purposes of effecting payment to You and servicing your account. Indeed shall pay each Ambassador within 30 days of the end of each calendar month for qualifying referrals during that month. Ambassador is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information associated with Ambassador’s account. Indeed may withhold any and all payment if Ambassador is in breach of these Terms and Indeed shall have no further liability to Ambassador.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ambassadors must refer Candidates to Seen through a unique referral link or other method provided by Indeed to identify the referring Ambassador. Candidates referred to Seen through other methods may not result in a commission. Referring a Candidate who is currently on, or previously applied to, the List will not result in a commission.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed will cooperate with law enforcement and other authorities in investigating claims of illegal activity or suspected illegal activity. Ambassadors shall cooperate with Indeed in any corrective action that Indeed deems necessary to correct and prevent violation of these Terms or applicable law, including without limitation providing Indeed with all information necessary to investigate the suspected violation.</span></li> 
         <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any Ambassador may terminate their participation in the Program at any time by sending a notice by email to support-at-indeed dot com or other email address specified by Indeed. Indeed may terminate the Program or any Ambassador’s participation in the Program at any time by sending a notice to the email address specified in the Ambassador’s profile.</span></li> 
        </ol> 
        <p><strong>6. Confidentiality</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to keep all information gained from using Seen by Indeed confidential. You agree that (1) you will use any content submitted by Candidates in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection laws; (2) you will not disclose the names, contact information, or identities of, or share the profile of, any Candidates in any List outside of your recruiting or hiring department; and (3) you will take appropriate physical, technical and administrative measures to protect content you obtain through use of Seen from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. You also agree not to post, publicly disclose or disseminate any job offers which you become aware of through Seen.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that by using Seen, Indeed may call you at the phone number provided to Indeed, including cell phone numbers. You further agree that Indeed provides email proxy and relay tools to the users of Seen and that Indeed may monitor, review, store and analyze your content (including your profile, applications, communications and responses) to provide you with personally relevant product features, prevent fraud, reduce unwanted mail, provide quality control, and improve the Site and Indeed services.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employer agrees that Indeed is entitled to publish the details of all non-binding offers made and the identity of those parties that have made such offers, unless the Employer has elected to remain anonymous.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>7. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">INDEED’S PROVISION OF SEEN BY INDEED AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO SEEN AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE, AND </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ANY WARRANTY THAT THE CANDIDATE PROFILE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO INDEED IS VALID, THAT THE COMMUNICATION SENT BY AN EMPLOYER WILL REACH THE INTENDED RECIPIENT, THAT THE INTENDED RECIPIENT OF THE COMMUNICATION SENT AT YOUR REQUEST WILL READ THE EMAIL, OR THAT THE INTENDED RECIPIENT OF YOUR REQUEST WILL ACT UPON SUCH REQUEST.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCEPT FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTIONS 6 OR 8 HEREUNDER, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU FOR THE INDEED TOOL GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>8. Indemnification</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Indeed from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (a) your violation of any term of this Agreement; (b) your use of, and access to Seen by Indeed; (c) your loss of, or disclosure of, information gained from using Seen; (d) your violation of any applicable laws during the hiring process, including but not limited to the US Fair Credit Reporting Act and any applicable data protection laws; (e) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any copyright, property, or privacy right; or (f) any claim that your content caused damage to a third party.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><strong>9. Termination</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may suspend Seen by Indeed, your account or any other provision of tools to you, and we may terminate this Agreement with you, at our sole discretion, at any time, with or without notice. If you wish to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by notifying Seen at any time and closing your account. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, success fee provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</span></p>

        <p>Last Updated: October 31, 2019</p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These Indeed Targeted Ads Terms (“ITA Terms”) form a part of, and are incorporated into, the </span><a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#tos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the “Agreement”), and apply to any Employer who accesses or uses the Indeed Targeted Ads program, or who otherwise indicates its acceptance of these ITA Terms. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These ITA Terms apply to both of Indeed’s Targeted Ads Services: 1) Indeed Targeted Ads: Brand (“ITA Brand”) and 2) Indeed Targeted Ads: Apply (“ITA Apply”).</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these ITA Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>1.</strong><b> The Program</b></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of Indeed Targeted Ads (“ITA”) on or through the Site is subject to all applicable Indeed terms and policies, including without limitation the Indeed Privacy Policy (</span><a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://www.indeed.com/legal#privacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and those instructions provided on the Site, and, if you are using ITA, through our online forms. Indeed policies may be modified at any time. With regards to any job advertisements posted on Indeed through ITA, (“Targeted Ads”), you agree that you are solely responsible for all: (a) ad or job content and target URLs (“Creative”), whether generated by or for you; including but not limited to photograph(s) you provide to Indeed; and (b) websites proximately reachable from Creative URLs and your services and products (collectively “Your Services”). You shall protect your passwords and take full responsibility for your own, and third party, use of your accounts. Targeted Ads may be placed on any content or property provided by Indeed (“Indeed Property”). By posting a Targeted Ad on Indeed, you authorize Indeed to reformat the Job Ad to be effectively displayed on a mobile device. Target audience membership is based partly on information and criteria provided by the Employer, but the composition of each target audience is determined by Indeed in its sole discretion.</span></p> 
        <p><b>ITA Apply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In order to participate in ITA Apply, you must either use Indeed Apply to receive applications or add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet to your post-apply page (the “Post-Apply Page”). The Post-Apply Page on which you add Indeed’s conversion tracker snippet shall be determined by mutual agreement between you and Indeed. However, please note that if you unilaterally place the conversion tracker snippet on a page other than the mutually agreed upon page, in violation of this agreement, Indeed will still count this page as the Post-Apply-Page, charge you for any Applies (as defined below) on this page, and may require you to correct the placement. Any removal of the tracker snippet will disqualify you from the program and will entitle to Indeed to any resulting damages. &nbsp;It shall be your responsibility to inform your job applicants that such tracker snippet is in place. The conversion tracker will attribute an application to Indeed any time the job seeker started their search on Indeed, despite any intervening activity. Additionally, if you receive the ITA Apply services, you may be given the option to include certain application questions for your Job Listing on an ITA ad as part of your application process. If you request that Indeed include the questions you have chosen as part of your ITA ad, you acknowledge that job seekers who do not answer your questions in the manner set forth in your instructions may not be permitted to proceed to the next stage of the application process, and that you are requesting that Indeed perform this action. You further acknowledge that your use of these application questions is provided to you via a license to the application questions tool and that Indeed disclaims all warranties as to the performance of these application questions, including but not limited to the accuracy of the job seekers’ answers to your application questions. &nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><strong>2.</strong><b> Cancellation</b></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless otherwise stated in an insertion order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel online any Targeted Ad at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours). Indeed may cancel ITA or these ITA Terms at any time. Indeed may modify ITA or these ITA Terms at any time without liability, and your use of ITA after notice that these ITA Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated ITA Terms. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these ITA Terms.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>3.</strong><b> Prohibited Uses</b></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shall not, and shall not authorize any party to (a) generate automated, fraudulent or otherwise invalid impressions, applies, or clicks; or (b) advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent business practice in any state or country where your advertisement is displayed. You represent and warrant that (x) all your information is correct and current; (y) you hold and grant Indeed and Partners all rights to copy, distribute and display Creative (“Use”); and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Targeted Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws. Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these ITA Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences. </span><b>Indeed or Partners may reject or remove any Targeted Ad, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.</b></p> 
        <p><strong>4.</strong><b> DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. Indeed and its affiliates, and its and their third-party licensors, disclaim all guarantees regarding positioning, accuracy, or the levels or timing of: (i) costs per apply or per click, (ii) costs per impression, (iii) apply and click rates, (iv) impression rates (including any estimate of impressions or term provided in an insertion order), (v) delivery of any impressions on any Partner Property or Indeed Property or sections of such properties, (vi) applies, (vii) impressions (viii) conversions for any Creative, (ix) targeted users, or (x) the interest-level of any users who apply to or view your job, or (xi) clicks. A CLICK ON YOUR JOB LISTING DOES NOT GUARANTEE INTEREST IN SUCH JOB LISTING.&nbsp; EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 HEREUNDER, AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTION 1, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE IAP TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE ITA TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU FOR THE JOB ADS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>5.</strong><b> Payment</b></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shall be charged in accordance with the pricing listed in a separate agreement or insertion order between you and Indeed, and based on applies (“Applies” or “Apply”) and clicks if you are an Employer using ITA Apply, or based on impressions (“Impression” or “Impressions”) if you are an employer using ITA Brand. Applies are defined as a user visit to the agreed upon Post-Apply Page listed in any separate agreement (including via email exchange) or insertion order between you and Indeed. Impressions are defined as an ad appearing on a page of the Site, which page has been presented to a Job Seeker. However, an Impression does not guarantee that a Job Seeker has viewed such ad. If you are an Employer using ITA Brand, your price per Impression found on any ITA Brand Insertion Order is defined as the cost per 1000 impressions. </span><b>If your ITA Insertion Order does not contain an end date, you will continue to be billed until you contact Indeed and request to be removed from the ITA Program.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If your Indeed employer account has a credit card on file for the Indeed Ads Program, we will charge that same credit card for your Indeed Targeted Ads.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">If your billing address is in the United States, you shall pay all charges in US Dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees. &nbsp;If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#asiaPacificList">Asia-Pacific Region*</a>, you may only pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen and US Dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your billing address is anywhere else, you may be able to pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euros, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, or Japanese Yen. This choice of currencies will be fully subject to Indeed’s discretion. Charges are exclusive of taxes, including VAT. You&nbsp;are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). </span><b>Charges are solely based on Indeed’s Apply measurements, click measurements, or Impressions measurements. Indeed’s determination of number of Applies, clicks or Impressions shall be binding.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of advertising credit for Indeed Property. You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore. Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>6.</strong><b> Indemnification</b></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, licensors and Partners from any third party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of your ITA use, Creative, site or Your Services, or your breach of these ITA Terms.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These API Terms incorporate the </span><a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#tos"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (the “Agreement”), and apply to anyone who accesses or uses an Application Programming Interface created or maintained by Indeed (“API”) or related documentation (“Documentation”), develops any application that communicates or interoperates with the API, the Site, or any Indeed service (“Application”), or who otherwise indicates acceptance of these API Terms. By agreeing to the API Terms, you also agree to the Indeed Terms of Service. Any capitalized terms that are used but not defined in these API Terms have the meaning set forth in the Agreement.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>1.&nbsp; The APIs</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed may provide you with access to one or more APIs, as well as any accompanying Documentation, solely for your internal business use in developing and using Applications.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your license is subject to and conditioned on your compliance with all terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, and it is revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable. No implied license is granted. Indeed reserves all rights that are not expressly granted by this Agreement.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may develop an Application that interoperates with an Indeed API for the use of your employees or independent contractors for your internal business purposes (“End Users”). Your and End Users’ use of an API or Application to access the Site or any Indeed App is subject to the applicable Terms of Service for the Site or Indeed App, and you agree to require your End Users to accept and comply with such Terms of Service as well as these API Terms. You agree that you will be responsible for your End Users’ use of your Application and any API. It is also you and your End Users’ responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App or the Site in order to obtain the most up to date information (including, but not limited to, explanations about how features work, disclaimers regarding the services provided, method for charging) about Indeed’s products and services. By using an Application via the API, rather than directly using the Site or an Indeed App, you agree to all information provided on the Site or an Indeed App. Use of an Application via the API, rather than direct use of the Site or an Indeed App, shall not excuse any lack of information or understanding about Indeed’s products and services, where that information is otherwise provided on the Site or an Indeed App.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that Indeed may monitor your and End Users’ use of any API and may process and analyze submitted information and behavioral data in accordance with the Indeed Privacy Policy. This monitoring may include Indeed accessing and using your Application. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Indeed may use any technical means to overcome such interference.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed reserves the right to place limits on access to any API (including without limitation the number of calls or requests), and monitor usage of the APIs to enforce these limits, in its sole discretion. Such limits may be detailed in the Documentation or otherwise communicated to you by Indeed.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed may update, modify or discontinue the API at any time and in our sole discretion and without liability to you, and may require you to obtain and use the most recent version. You are required to update your Application accordingly at your sole expense. You acknowledge that Indeed’s update to an API may adversely affect how your Application communicates with the Site or an Indeed App, and you agree that Indeed will have no liability therefrom. Your use of an API after an update by Indeed constitutes acceptance of the update. Indeed reserves the right to develop products or services that are similar to, or may compete with, any Application.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><strong>2. Restrictions</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessing and using the Site or any Indeed App through an API is subject to the Site Rules and any additional rules and policies made available by Indeed.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to do all the following in connection with your access and use of any API or development or use of any Application: (a) comply with the Agreement, the Site Rules, all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and all guidelines, standards, and requirements that may be made available to you by Indeed from time to time; (b) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitor the use of your Applications for any activity that violates these API Terms; (c) promptly restrict any End Users who violate these API Terms from further use of your Application; and (d) promptly notify Indeed of any violation of these API Terms by you or End Users.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that neither you, your Application, nor your End Users, will do any of the following in connection with your access or use of any API or development or use of any Application: (a) violate any Site Rule or other rule or policy pertaining to the Site, or any applicable law or regulation; (b) copy, duplicate, modify, or create derivative works of an API, in whole or in part; (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to any source code component of the API; (d) remove any proprietary notices from any materials available through the API; (e) make an API or Application available to a third party except as permitted by a written agreement with Indeed; (f) circumvent any limits on API access imposed by Indeed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; or (g) scrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of any User Content, except as expressly permitted by the Documentation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to provide and adhere to a Privacy Policy for your Application that accurately describes to End Users what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Indeed and other third parties.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>3. Access and API Key</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree to only access an API by the means described in its Documentation. Indeed may require that you use a password, key or other security device to access an API (“API Key”). Instructions for obtaining an API Key are included in the applicable Documentation. You are responsible for all access to and use of the API under your API Key. You agree to maintain the confidentiality and security of your API Key, to not share it with any third party, and use it only in compliance with these API Terms. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your Application’s identity. Your API Key may be revoked at any time by Indeed.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><strong>4.&nbsp; Intellectual Property</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You understand and acknowledge that Indeed or its affiliates, or its or their licensors, owns all right title and interest to the API, the Site, and Indeed Apps, and all proprietary rights associated therewith. Indeed reserves all rights not specifically granted herein. You shall not modify any copyright notices, proprietary legends, any trademark and service mark attributions, any patent markings, or other indicia of ownership on the materials accessed through the API, other than your User Content.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we may use such information without obligation to you.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge that User Content as defined in the Agreement may be available via the APIs, and that User Content is the sole responsibility of the person who provided it to Indeed.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><strong>5.&nbsp; Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THE SITE, APIS, AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITH NO WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SECURITY, RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE APIS AND DOCUMENTATION, AND ALL MATERIALS, INFORMATION, ADVICE, JOB LISTINGS, USER CONTENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH ANY API. INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES FOR SERVICES OR GOODS RECEIVED THROUGH ANY API.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ACCESS AND USE AN INDEED API AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM ANY SUCH ACCESS OR USE.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU CREATE AN APPLICATION AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGES TO YOUR OR ANY OTHER PERSON’S COMPUTER SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM YOUR APPLICATION.</span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 8 HEREUNDER AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTION 1, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE API TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE API TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU FOR THE INDEED SERVICE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>6.&nbsp; Payment</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you have a separate written agreement with Indeed, you shall be charged based on your and your End Users’ use of an Indeed App or the Site, in accordance with that Indeed App’s or Site’s Terms of Service and other payment information made available on the Indeed App or Site, and based on Indeed’s measurements of usage. It is your and your End Users’ responsibility to regularly review any Indeed App or the Site in order to obtain the most up to date information regarding payment and how Indeed charges you for your use of Indeed’s products and services.</span></p> 
        <p><strong>7.&nbsp; Cancelation</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless otherwise stated in an agreement with Indeed, you may cancel this Agreement at any time by ceasing your use of the APIs and deleting your Application. Indeed may discontinue any API or any portion or feature or your access thereto for any reason and at any time without liability or other obligation to you. Indeed may immediately cancel the API or these API Terms at any time upon notice. Indeed may modify these API Terms at any time without liability, and your use of an API or Application after notice that these API Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated API Terms. </span></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon cancelation of this Agreement: (a) your license to access or use any Indeed API immediately expires; and (b) you shall delete your Application</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and all User Content acquired through the Site or API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You agree that Indeed may notify any End User to provide notice of the cancelation of this Agreement or of your right to use an API. Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 will survive these API Terms.&nbsp;</span></p> 
        <p><strong>8.&nbsp; Indemnification</strong></p> 
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, and licensors from any third-party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of your or End Users’ API use, User Content, your Application, or breach of these API Terms.</span></p>

        <p>Unless otherwise stated in an Insertion Order or other agreement to advertise with Indeed, you may independently cancel any Job Listing or Job Ad (and corresponding Event) at any time (such cancellation is generally effective within 24 hours). However, if you cancel an Event, Indeed will still bill you in accordance with any pricing listed in a separate agreement or otherwise agreed upon by you and Indeed, for RSVPs, clicks, applies or impressions accrued while the Job Ad for that Event was on the Site, and any platform fee, if applicable. Indeed may reach out to Job Seekers to communicate your Event cancellation. Indeed may immediately cancel the Program, any part thereof, or these IHEPP Terms at any time upon notice. Indeed may modify the Program or these IHEP Terms at any time without liability, and your use of the Program after notice that these IHEP Terms have changed indicates acceptance of the updated IHEP Terms. Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 will survive any expiration or termination of these IHEP Terms.</p> 
        <p><strong>3. Prohibited Uses</strong></p> 
        <p>You shall not, and shall not authorize or assist any party to, advertise anything illegal or engage in any illegal or fraudulent activities or business practices in any state or country where your Job Listing or Job Ad is displayed. You represent and warrant that (x) all your information and any and all information you provide to Indeed is correct and current; (y) you hold and grant Indeed and Partners all rights to copy, distribute, and display Job Listings or Job Ads (“Use”); and (z) such Use and websites linked from your Jobs Listings or Jobs Ads (including Your Services therein) will not violate or encourage violation of any applicable laws. Violation of these policies may result in immediate termination of these IHEP Terms or your account without notice, and may subject you to legal penalties and consequences.&nbsp;<strong>Indeed or Partners may reject or remove any Job Listing, Job Ad, or content therein, and Indeed may disable any Employer’s account, for any or no reason without notice.</strong></p> 
        <p><strong>4. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</strong></p> 
        <p>INDEED’S PROVISION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE SITE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM AND YOUR USE THEREOF, INDEED AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR THIRD-PARTY LICENSORS, DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE. Indeed and its affiliates, and its and their third-party licensors, disclaim all guarantees regarding positioning or the levels or timing of: (i) costs per RSVP, click, apply, or impression, (ii) RSVP rates, click through rates, apply rates, or impression rates (including any estimate of rates provided in an insertion order), (iii) delivery of any impressions on any Partner Property or Indeed Property or sections of such properties, (iv) RSVPs, clicks, applies or impressions, (v) interest in your Job Ad, (vi) attendance at your Event(s), and (vii) the quality of attendees at your Event(s). AN RSVP TO YOUR EVENT(S) DOES NOT GUARANTEE INTEREST IN YOUR JOB AD. EXCEPT FOR AMOUNTS PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 6 HEREUNDER, AND FOR ANY BREACH BY YOU OF SECTION 1, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW: (a) NEITHER PARTY WILL BE LIABLE UNDER THESE IHEP TERMS FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR OTHER DAMAGES WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY; AND (b) EACH PARTY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER THESE IHEP TERMS IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS PAID OR PAYABLE TO INDEED BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR THE JOB ADS OR JOB LISTINGS GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p> 
        <p><strong>5. Payment</strong></p> 
        <p>You shall be charged in accordance with the pricing listed in a separate agreement or insertion order between you and Indeed, and based on clicks, RSVPs, applies or impressions (distributed within your budget in Indeed’s sole discretion) and platform fee, if applicable. RSVPs are defined as a user completing the online RSVP form agreeing to attend your Event featured in any Job Ad. However, an RSVP does not guarantee that a Job Seeker will attend such Event. If your Indeed employer account has a credit card on file for the Indeed Ads Program or any other Indeed service, we will charge that same credit card for your Indeed Hiring Events RSVPs, if applicable.</p> 
        <p>If you are located in the United States, you shall pay all applicable charges in US dollars. If your billing address is in India, you may only pay all charges in Indian Rupees. If your billing address is in Brazil, you may only pay all charges in Brazilian Reais. If your billing address is in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.indeed.com/legal?hl=en#asiaPacificList">Asia-Pacific Region*</a>, you may only pay all charges in Singapore Dollars, Australian Dollars, Japanese Yen, and US Dollars. If your billing address is anywhere else, you may pay all charges in the following currencies, which you choose when creating an account: US Dollars, Euros, UK Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Australian Dollars, Swiss Francs, or Japanese Yen. Charges are exclusive of all taxes, including VAT. You&nbsp;are responsible for all taxes as applicable and appropriate. You are responsible for paying (y) all taxes and government charges, and (z) reasonable expenses and attorney fees Indeed incurs collecting late amounts. If you are in Japan, Japanese consumption tax will apply on the import of all Indeed products and services. You waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights).&nbsp;<strong>Charges are solely based on Indeed’s click, RSVP, apply, or impression measurements. Indeed’s determination of number of clicks, RSVPs, applies or impressions shall be binding.</strong>&nbsp;Refunds (if any) are at the absolute discretion of Indeed and only in the form of advertising credit for Indeed Property. If you are removed from Indeed, but have previously spent on Indeed, you are not entitled to a refund of previously spent amounts.</p> 
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that any credit card and related billing and payment information that you provide to Indeed may be shared by Indeed with companies who work on Indeed’s behalf, such as payment processors and/or credit agencies, solely for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment to Indeed and servicing your account. Indeed may also provide information in response to valid legal process, such as subpoenas, search warrants and court orders, or to establish or exercise its legal rights or defend against legal claims. Indeed shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties.</p> 
        <p>All withholding tax remittances to the government are your sole responsibility and Indeed shall have no liability whatsoever therefore. Invoices may be provided to you via electronic mail. To the extent permitted by law, if you have an unpaid or outstanding invoice or account balance for any Indeed product, Indeed reserves the right to suspend or terminate your use of that Indeed product as well as any other Indeed product, including but not limited to those Indeed products where you do not have an unpaid invoice or account balance.</p> 
        <p><strong>6. Indemnification</strong></p> 
        <p>You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indeed, its agents, affiliates, licensors, and Partners from any third party claim or liability (including without limitation reasonable legal fees) arising out of your Program use, Job Listing, Job Ad, screening or screener questions, Event, Site or Your Services, or breach of these IHEP Terms.</p>

        <p><strong>Program Description</strong></p> 
        <p>As part of Indeed’s commitment to the security of our job seekers, advertisers, and publishers, we partnered with <a href="http://www.bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> to launch our Vulnerability Reward Program. Detailed rules and information about the scope of this bounty program are available on our <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/indeed">Bugcrowd page</a>. If you are a whitehat researcher that believes you have discovered a vulnerability in an Indeed product or have any other security inquiries, please <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/user/sign_up">sign up as a Bugcrowd Tester</a> to be included in Indeed’s Vulnerability Reward Program. Vulnerabilities submitted outside of Bugcrowd will <strong>not</strong> be considered.</p> 
        <p><strong>Legal Notes</strong></p> 
        <p>Indeed will not issue rewards to researchers from countries on sanctions lists (e.g. – Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria). There may be additional restrictions on your ability to enter depending upon your local laws. Your testing must not violate any law, or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own.</p>
