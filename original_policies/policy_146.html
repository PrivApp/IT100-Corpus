<h4>WE RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY<br>
If you have any privacy related concerns, please contact us at:
support(at)bubadu.com. </h4>
<p><strong> Bubadu d.o.o is a company registered in Slovenia, with registration number 7117060000 and address at this date at Bračičeva ulica 21, 1380 Cerknica, Slovenia, EU (‘’Bubadu’’, ‘’We’’), who offers entertaining mobile applications (‘’App/s’’). This privacy statement describes how Bubadu collects and uses the information and/or data (the terms are used interchangeably) you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your information and how you can access the information. We respect your privacy and we take protecting it seriously.</strong></p>
<h4>GDPR STATEMENT</h4>
<p>We have changed our data processing practices to comply with the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (EU GDPR) by following the data minimisation principle and anonymising, pseudonymising or deleting personal data where feasible. When using our services the advertising identifier will be anonymised by encryption in a way that we won’t be able to decrypt it without your help. This means that we will only store these personally identifiable data: a) analytics identifier used for the purposes of internal analytics and b) IP address on third party webservers for security reasons to help us detect and prevent fraudulent activity and to get country information needed for cross promo ads. We will still need to enable our Advertising Providers to collect your advertising identifier, IP address and other data to show you ads. We have executed Data Processing Agreements with such partners to make sure your data is safe. Your can opt out of advertising at any time by following instructions in Right To Object Section of this GDPR Statement. Should you not want Third Party Providers (Apple, Google, FB ) to use your data for the functionalities within the App, please do not log in or use their services. Some of the Third Party Providers store or transfer data outside EEA.</p>
<h4>Personal Information Processing</h4>
<p>You can use our Apps in two ways. By using the <strong>free version</strong>, we will anonymise personally identifiable information, but still enable the transfer of your advertising identifier, IP address and other data to our Advertising Providers and Analytics Providers. We will show you only contextual ads and we do not allow any profiling or behavioural ads. Our free App versions already include the minimal possible data collection and processing, so we are confident you will feel comfortable sharing your data with us. By voluntarily signing into Third Party Providers functionalities within our App, you allow the usage of your data to such third parties (FB, Game Centre, in-app purchase providers).</p>
<h4>Right to object and to restriction of processing</h4>
<p>Because we process your data on legitimate interests basis, you have the right to object to our processing as well as the right to restriction on processing namely the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future. We have limited the amount of personal data we collect to advertising identifier and IP address and anonymise/pseudonymise our processing where feasible. When you use our free App version, we process your data only for analytics to improve our services and to display ads. You have the right to object to data processing for advertising and analytical services by choosing these options <strong>‘’Remove Ads’’ or ‘’Buy Full Version’’</strong> available within the App (as button on homepage) or in the app store. When you choose this option we disable any future advertising and analytics and stop sharing and using your data for these purposes. You will still be shown cross-promo ads, namely ads for our services within our Apps, which means that your encrypted advertising identifier will only be used for this type of advertising without involving any third parties. We will use your country data to show appropriate cross promo ads, but we won’t store it for more than three (3) days. Your IP address will be processed on third party web servers and shall be used for security reasons only. Your data will be automatically deleted from our logs within one (1) month and from backup logs within two (2) months. Should you want to object to Third Party Providers functionalities data collection within our App, stop using these functionalities, namely FB and Game Center or opt out of notifications within the settings of your mobile device and request deletion of data by contacting us or such providers. Should you not feel comfortable with this lighter version of your data processing, you have the right to object to us using your data by sending an email to support(at)bubadu.com or exercise your right to erasure. </p>
<h4>Right to data portability, copy and rectification</h4>

The logs with your data will be deleted within one (1) month and backup logs within two (2) months. We will also ask our Providers to delete the data they may have.</p>
<h4>Purpose and legal basis for data processing</h4>
<p>We process your data by conducting internal analytics to improve our service, to display contextual ads and for security reasons. We have adhered to the data minimisation principle and we only collect the data we need for our processing purposes. We anonymize and/or pseudonymise the data on our end.

<h4>USAGE OF INFORMATION </h4>
<p>We use the Information we collect with the help of our Analytics Providers to constantly improve our Apps and make them better for you, as well as to display advertisements with our Advertising Providers which enables us to offer some of our apps to you for free. We chose our Providers carefully and request their compliance with valid legislation.</p>
<p>We and our Analytics Providers use the Non-Personal Information to understand and optimize how our Apps are used, improve our marketing efforts, provide our content and features that are of interest to you, for statistics, analytics, research and development in order to continuously improve our apps and make them better for you. This includes correcting technical malfunctions, customization, providing better and improved content, developing new offers, measuring traffic and usage of our apps, promoting the apps and improving the user experience. We use aggregated and anonymized data log files and the activities of the user within our apps for internal analytics to improve our Apps.</p>
<p>We also use your Information to permit certain functionalities available within the apps (such as in-app purchases), permit you to use the Game Center Features and send you local notifications to your device. We will only use local notifications to remind you about your activities within the App.</p>
<p>In order to offer some of our Apps for free, we need to use the Information to display advertisements (banners, interstitials) with the help of our Advertising Providers. The Apps include third parties’ SDK’s to collect the Information needed to display advertisements. The Information is used for ad serving features such as frequency capping (so that you are not displayed with the same ad twice etc.) and ad mediation. The Information may be stored on the user’s device through generally accepted industry technologies used within our apps (such as cookies, local storage). Our Advertising Providers may use cookies and other web-tracking technologies to collect Non-personal Information in case the user clicks on any of their advertisements. Furthermore, Bubadu may advertise other Bubadu apps within its apps.</p>
<p>Our Advertising Providers are allowed to use the Information to provide contextual advertisements, conduct ad mediation, for support for internal operations and on an anonymized basis to improve their products by conducting research and analysis with the use of aggregated advertising information to understand and optimize how the advertisements are used.</p>
<p>We select Advertising Providers attentively to maintain compliance with applicable privacy laws hence we only allow the display of contextual advertisements to Apps that are child directed or mixed audience. Furthermore, we flag persistent identifiers used in child directed or mixed audience apps in order to ensure our Advertising Providers are able to comply with child protection legislation namely COPPA restrictions in the US territory, meaning they are allowed to use Personal Information solely for the purposes of internal operations and contextual advertising but are prohibited from contacting a user, including through behavioral advertising; to amass a profile on a user; or use the Information for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics and Google Firebase to collect the Information in order to analyze and improve our Apps. Collected Information will only be used for support for internal operations namely to maintain or analyze the functioning of the App, perform network communications, authenticate users in, or personalize the content in the App, protect the security or integrity of the user or App and ensure legal or regulatory compliance. We collect local notification tokens in order for us to be able to determine whether you are subscribed to notifications. When you decide to unsubscribe from local notifications, such local notification tokens will be deleted from our database. We have implemented the following Google Analytics for Firebase Features: Crash Reporting and Events. We use Cookies as stated throughout this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We use third party Webserver Providers, namely CloudFlare to store your IP address for the purposes of security. Please see Section ‘’Webserver Providers’’ for more info on how they use your data. </p>
<h4>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h4><p>
Sometimes we need to disclose the Information for other lawful purposes, as customary for all App developers.
</p>

<ul><li><p>if required by law, for example to comply with a court order, subpoena, regulation, legal process or other governmental request;</p></li><li><p>to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company, our users or others;</p></li><li><p>to enforce this privacy statement, including investigation of potential violations thereof;</p></li><li>

</li>
<li><p>to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;</p></li><li>
